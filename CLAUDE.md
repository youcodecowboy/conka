# CONKA Website – Claude Instructions

Headless Shopify e-commerce site. Next.js App Router + TypeScript, hosted on Vercel.

## Operating efficiency

Speed and token cost matter. On any task that is not large:

- **Edit, don't rewrite.** Use targeted `Edit` calls. Never regenerate a whole file for a small change.
- **Never `npm run lint`** (whole repo). Lint only what you changed: `npm run lint:changed` (or `npx eslint <file>`).
- **Batch independent tool calls** into one turn instead of one per round-trip.
- **Keep prose tight.** Do the work; don't narrate options you won't take.
- **Delegate big reads** (multi-file searches, large docs) to a subagent so the main context stays lean.
- **`/clear` between unrelated tasks** so each reply isn't reprocessing a long history.

## Current strategic direction (updated Aug 2026)

**Read `docs/development/CODEBASE_AUDIT_AND_ROADMAP.md` (current state + prioritised roadmap) and `docs/TODO.md` (deferred work and tech debt tracker) before starting any feature work.** The simplification started in March 2026 has now largely landed:

- **Protocols: presentation layer is deleted, commerce layer is live.** The 4-protocol system was replaced by a simple Flow / Clear / Both offering. `app/protocol/`, `app/components/protocol/` and the `app/lib/protocol*.ts` modules are **gone**. `ProtocolId`, `PROTOCOL_VARIANTS` and `app/lib/legacy/protocolSubscriptions.ts` remain as **live legacy support for existing subscribers** — do not delete them. See `docs/development/featurePlans/asset-and-protocol-cleanup.md`.
- **Ad landing pages — shipped.** `/go/[slug]` serves paid Meta traffic as listicles and landing quizzes (noindex, not in main nav). See `docs/features/LISTICLE_SYSTEM.md` and `docs/features/LANDING_QUIZ_SYSTEM.md`.
- **Funnel — shipped and consolidated.** The three funnel variants collapsed into `/build-your-order` (SCRUM-1247): 3 cadences × 3 products, straight to Shopify checkout, no cart drawer. `/funnel`, `/funnel-b` and `/funnel-c` are deleted and redirect there.
- **Quiz — deleted**, not hidden. `/quiz/:path*` permanently redirects to `/build-your-order`. The `/go/[slug]` landing quizzes are a separate, unrelated system.
- **Shop page — deleted.** `/shop` and `/shop/:path*` permanently redirect to `/conka-both`.
- **Subscriptions are on Skio.** Migration completed 2026-09-02 and Loop is decommissioned: `app/lib/loop.ts`, the Loop API routes and the self-built account portal are all deleted, and `/account` redirects to Skio's embedded portal at `/account/manage`. See `docs/features/SUBSCRIPTIONS.md` (canonical) and `docs/features/CUSTOMER_PORTAL.md`. The migration and decommission plans are archived under `docs/development/featurePlans/archive/`.

## Git workflow

**Never commit directly to `main`.** Always create a feature branch, make changes there, and open a PR.

```bash
git checkout -b my-feature-branch   # create branch off main
# … make changes …
git push -u origin my-feature-branch
```

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev        # Start dev server
npm run build      # Production build
npm run lint       # ESLint
npm run dev:all    # Dev + any parallel processes
```

## Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Commerce:** Shopify Storefront API (`@shopify/storefront-api-client`) — cart only; checkout is Shopify-hosted via `cart.checkoutUrl`
- **Database:** Convex (see `docs/deployment/CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT.md`)
- **Hosting:** Vercel

## Key files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `app/context/CartContext.tsx` | Global cart state — `addToCart`, `updateQuantity`, `removeItem`, `clearCart`. Cart ID stored in `localStorage` under `shopify_cart_id`. |
| `app/context/AuthContext.tsx` | Global auth state |
| `app/api/cart/route.ts` | Proxies cart actions to Shopify Storefront API |
| `app/components/CartDrawer.tsx` | Slide-out cart UI; "Checkout" links to `cart.checkoutUrl` |
| `app/lib/productData.ts` | **Barrel export** — always import product data from here, never from sub-modules |
| `app/brand-base.css` | Design system tokens and layout classes (the only stylesheet; `premium-base.css` is deleted) |
| `app/lib/site.ts` | Brand identity constants. `COMPANY.email` is the **canonical public contact address — `info@conka.io`**. Never hard-code a contact address; import `SUPPORT_EMAIL` / `supportMailtoHref()` from `app/lib/supportEmail.ts`. B2B is the only exception (named owner in `app/lib/b2bData.ts`) |
| `app/layout.tsx` | Root layout — nav, footer, CartDrawer, analytics scripts |

## Product data

Data is split into focused modules; import everything from the barrel:

```typescript
import { FormulaId, formulaContent, formatPrice } from "@/app/lib/productData";
```

Modules (no circular deps): `productTypes` → `productColors`, `formulaContent`, `productImages` → `productHelpers`

Key helpers: `formatPrice(n)`, `getBillingLabel(billing)`. B2B tiers are not in this barrel: `getB2BTier(qty)` lives in `app/lib/b2bPricing.ts`.

**Prices you can sell at live in `app/lib/offerData.ts`**, not in the barrel. The PDPs reach it through the `cadenceData.ts` adapter. The old main-site `productPricing.ts` was deleted in SCRUM-1280.

## Design system

Full spec: `docs/branding/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`. All tokens and classes live in `app/brand-base.css` — the single stylesheet. The old `app/premium-base.css` ("Soft-Tech Luxury") has been **deleted**; its still-referenced tokens are folded into `brand-base.css` Layer 3 as `@deprecated`. Do not reference `premium-*` classes or `--premium-radius-*` tokens — they no longer exist.

**Direction.** The visual system has evolved premium → clinical → **Simple DTC**. Simple DTC is the forward language (rounded pills/cards, filled navy `#1B2757` as primary/decorative, green `#1a7f4f` savings accent, light-navy `#eef0f5` tint strips, shadows/rings allowed, sans by default) and governs cart / nav / PDP acquisition surfaces. **Clinical** (`.brand-clinical`: zero radii, mono data labels, navy interactive-only) is retained for evidence-dense surfaces (`/science`) and the `/app` dark pages, not the default for new work. See DESIGN_SYSTEM.md §8.5 for the full Simple DTC spec and per-surface authority table.

**The pattern — page orchestrates, components are content-only:**

```tsx
// Page (owns section wrapper, background, track)
<section className="brand-section brand-bg-white" aria-label="Benefits">
  <div className="brand-track">
    <MyComponent />  {/* no <section>, no max-w, no px-* at root */}
  </div>
</section>
```

**Key classes:**
- `.brand-section` — section padding + gutters (5vw desktop, 1.25rem mobile)
- `.brand-track` — max-width 1280px, centred; no own padding
- `.brand-bg-white` / `.brand-bg-tint` / `.brand-bg-black` — section backgrounds
- `.brand-h1` / `.brand-h2` / `.brand-h3` / `.brand-body` — typography (left-aligned by default)
- Radius tokens: `--brand-radius-interactive` (16px) / `--brand-radius-container` (24px) / `--brand-radius-card` (32px); `.brand-clinical` forces all three to `0px`

**Component rules:**
- Components return content only — no `<section>`, no `max-w-*`, no `px-*` at root
- Components do not set their own background
- Cards/surfaces that differ from the section background must set their own text color explicitly
- Use design tokens from `app/brand-base.css` — never hard-code colours, spacing, radii, or font sizes

## Analytics

- **Vercel Analytics** (`app/lib/analytics.ts`) — quiz events + add-to-cart with `source`/`location`
- **Triple Whale** (`app/lib/tripleWhale.ts`) — AddToCart only
- **Meta Pixel** (`app/lib/metaPixel.ts`) — PageView, ViewContent, AddToCart, InitiateCheckout (browser-side)
- **Meta CAPI** (`app/api/meta/events/route.ts`) — server-side deduplication
- **GA + Klaviyo** — scripts in `app/layout.tsx`

All analytics fire from `CartContext` after successful cart mutations. Pass `metadata` (`location`, `source`, `sessionId`) to `addToCart` for funnel tagging.

## Cart — important details

- Cart ID persisted in `localStorage` as `shopify_cart_id`; cart data lives in Shopify
- No custom checkout — redirect to `cart.checkoutUrl`
- **B2B tier pricing:** volume tiers live in `app/lib/b2bPricing.ts` (`getB2BTier(boxes)`, `B2B_TIERS`); there is no automatic cart-mutation tier normalization
- `clearCart()` removes localStorage reference only; the Shopify cart still exists until it expires

## Routes

**Active:** `/` home · `/conka-flow` · `/conka-clarity` · `/conka-both` · `/build-your-order` (Build Your Order flow, noindex; data layer `app/lib/offerData.ts` + `byoCheckout.ts`) · `/professionals` · `/account` · `/go/[slug]` (ad landing quizzes + listicles, noindex) · `/start`/`/lander` (redirect to `-b` trial variants) · static content pages (`/science`, `/our-story`, `/why-conka`, `/ingredients`, `/app`, `/case-studies`)
**Being removed:** `/protocol/[id]` (redirect) · `/quiz` (redirect) · `/shop` (redirect) · `/funnel`, `/funnel-b`, `/funnel-c` (redirect to `/build-your-order`, SCRUM-1247)
