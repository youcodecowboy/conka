## April 2026

### 2026-04-08 — /start performance optimisation (65 → 85+ target)
Two rounds of performance work on the ad landing page. **Round 1:** Moved page composition from a single `"use client"` wrapper (`StartPageClient`) to a server component so HTML is pre-rendered — eliminated ~2.3s LCP element render delay. Dynamic-imported 5 below-fold sections (ProductSplit, ValueComparison, Benefits, FAQ, CaseStudies) to reduce initial JS bundle. Removed `will-change` and 0ms `reveal-cleanup` animations that caused non-composited animation warnings. Added explicit width/height to footer logo. Removed unused Shopify preconnect hints (cart API is server-side proxied). **Round 2:** Deferred CookieYes to `lazyOnload` — the cookie banner was being measured as the LCP element (1,890ms render delay). Deferred Klaviyo to `lazyOnload` (signup popups not needed at initial load; footer newsletter uses direct API). Replaced nav logo `conka.svg` (593KB — embedded raster PNG in an SVG wrapper) with a generated `conka-logo.webp` (7.5KB, 440×112 2x retina), saving 585KB on every page load site-wide. Switched footer logo from `conka.png` (48KB) to the same WebP. Tightened hero image `sizes` attribute.
**Why:** `/start` is the primary paid traffic landing page (74% mobile). Score was 65; target is 85+. CookieYes as LCP and the 593KB SVG logo were the two largest remaining bottlenecks after the server component restructure.
**Branch:** `second-optimisatio-round`, `third-round-optimisation`

### 2026-04-08 — Funnel P2: product selection, plan page, upsell, and Evening-to-Afternoon audit
Funnel product selection (Step 1): removed feature-bashing caption, header to "Your CONKA plan", product descriptions rewritten to outcome-focused copy, dynamic CTA showing product name + per-shot price with sub-label. Funnel plan page (Step 2): header to "Your delivery plan", mobile hero removed, per-product accent colors on cadence cards (blue/amber/teal), price anchors switched to £3.75/shot trial pack reference with savings %, dynamic CTA per cadence. Upsell bottom sheet (renamed from UpsellModal): per-shot hero block showing price drop, new copy and benefit bullets, social nudge line, backdrop dismiss separated from decline-to-checkout. Global terminology audit: replaced "Evening" with "Afternoon" for CONKA Clear across 10 files (testimonials untouched).
**Why:** P2 priority work before scaling paid spend. Sharper copy, dynamic pricing CTAs, and per-product visual identity reduce decision fatigue in the funnel. "Afternoon" aligns with updated product positioning.
**Tickets:** SCRUM-862, SCRUM-863, SCRUM-864
**Plan:** `docs/development/featurePlans/landing-page-upgrades.md` (Phases 3-5)
**Branch:** `landing-page-upgrades`

### 2026-04-07 — Homepage performance + brand-base migration
Simplified homepage hero from 4-image carousel to single product image (matching `/start` LandingHero pattern). Removed rotating headline words, desktop/mobile split, and carousel JS. Added `loading="lazy"` to all below-fold images across 7 components (~25 images). Converted raw `<img>` tags to `next/image` in LandingFAQ and KeyBenefitsDesktop. Then migrated all 10 homepage sections from `premium-base.css` to `brand-base.css`: replaced section wrappers, applied white/tint alternating backgrounds, updated all component tokens (74 replacements across 11 files), moved WhyConkaWorks from dark to light background, left-aligned all headers, updated radius values (32/24/16px), and applied accent-only CTA buttons.
**Why:** Homepage was visually inconsistent with `/start` landing page (different design system, dark sections, centred headers, pill buttons). Carousel added JS weight and 3 unnecessary image requests. Homepage is the primary organic entry point and needed to match the brand standard.
**Tickets:** SCRUM-855, SCRUM-856
**Plan:** `docs/development/featurePlans/homepage-upgrade.md`
**Migration tracker:** `docs/development/WEBSITE_STYLING_MIGRATION.md`

### 2026-04-07 — /start mobile performance optimization
Lighthouse mobile score was 63/100 with 9.2s LCP. Added AVIF/WebP image formats and cache config to `next.config.ts`. Lazy-loaded below-fold images (FlowHold 658KB, ClearDrink, AppConkaRing). Trimmed legacy Google Font weights (Syne, DM Sans, Caveat, IBM Plex Mono) to only weights actually used. Deferred Triple Pixel from `afterInteractive` to `lazyOnload`. Added preconnect hints for GA and Meta domains. Replaced inline hero animation styles with CSS classes. Updated `/implement` and `/review` skills with performance-conscious defaults.
**Why:** Performance is the highest-leverage CRO fix for the primary paid traffic landing page (74% mobile). Prerequisite for Phase 1 benefits redesign (SCRUM-850).
**Ticket:** SCRUM-852
**Plan:** `docs/development/featurePlans/landing-benefits-redesign.md` (Phase 0)

### 2026-04-02 — Landing page visual system
Replaced the heavy black/neutral section backgrounds with a single subtle tint (`#f4f5f8`). CTA buttons now use brand accent (`#4058bb`). Established 4-tier text colour system (100/80/60/40%), consistent heading spacing (`mb-10`), and killed all inline style opacity. Product split cards now show individual bottle images instead of shared AM/PM lifestyle shot. Footnote anchors styled as muted superscript.
**Why:** Competitive analysis (Headstrong, Overload, AG1, Magic Mind) showed the page was too heavy. Evidence-based approach documented in `docs/branding/LANDING_PAGE_VISUAL_SYSTEM.md`.
**PR:** #150

### 2026-04-01 — Testimonial section on homepage
Testimonial heading/subtitle now inherit text colour from the parent section background.
**PR:** #149

### 2026-04-01 — Funnel CRO optimisation (3 phases)
Reordered funnel to Product > Cadence > Checkout. Reworked upsell logic. Hardened copy across landing and funnel pages. Migrated landing + funnel from `premium-base.css` to `brand-base.css`. Fixed compliance, alt text, and anchor consistency.
**Why:** Conversion rate optimisation following initial funnel build.
**PR:** #148

### 2026-04-01 — Cookie consent banner
Added CookieYes consent banner for GDPR compliance.
**PR:** #146

### 2026-04-01 — Legal pages
Created terms, privacy policy, and cookies pages. Updated contact email to info@conka.io.
**Why:** Legal requirement before running paid traffic.
**PR:** #145

### 2026-04-01 — Landing page code quality
Review-driven cleanup: guarantee mismatch fix, noindex added, server component conversion, code quality pass.
**PR:** #144

## March 2026

### 2026-03-31 — Brand guidelines integration
New `brand-base.css` design system tokens. Added Neue Haas Grotesk and JetBrains Mono fonts. Created claims compliance doc, brand voice doc, quality standards. Established local rules for components and pages.
**Why:** New brand direction from marketing. Previous system (`premium-base.css`) was ad-hoc. Needed a single source of truth.
**PR:** #143

### 2026-03-31 — Development workflow improvement
Added quality standards doc. Enforced mobile-first across workflows. Added brand voice, code review, UX iteration, and Jira workflow docs.
**PR:** #142

**PR:** #141

### 2026-03-27 — Funnel page UX iteration
Better styling, layout, pre-selection defaults, copy refinement, upsell improvements. Integrated real Shopify product data for Flow/Clear monthly variants.
**Why:** Iterating toward launch-ready state after initial build.
**PRs:** #137, #138, #139, #140

### 2026-03-25-26 — Funnel page built
Multi-step paginated funnel (Plan > Product > Checkout). Standalone data layer (`funnelData.ts`), isolated checkout flow (`funnelCheckout.ts`), step indicator, upsell modal, analytics events. Mobile-first.
**Why:** January Brands workshop identified frictionless funnel as the primary conversion lever. Overload/Fussy pattern.
**PR:** #137

### 2026-03-25 — Landing page built
8-section landing page at `/start` for paid Meta traffic. Hero, benefits, product split, what's inside, testimonials, guarantee, case studies, FAQ. All CTAs point to `/funnel`. Noindex.
**Why:** Paid traffic needs a dedicated conversion page, not the homepage.
**PR:** #136

### 2026-03-24 — Website simplification plan
Created `WEBSITE_SIMPLIFICATION_PLAN.md` and `CONKA_BUSINESS_CONTEXT.md` documenting the pivot from protocols to Flow/Clear/Both.
**Why:** January Brands workshop. Protocols are too confusing, killing conversion from paid traffic.

### 2026-03-13 — Customer portal aligned to Loop
Added cancellation modal with winback discount, reorder for single products, apply discount code functionality.
**Why:** Aligning the customer portal to Loop's subscription management features.
**PR:** #135
