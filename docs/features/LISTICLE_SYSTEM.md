# Listicle System

> **Purpose:** How to create and maintain the "N reasons" listicle landing pages served at `/go/[slug]`.
>
> **Shared `/go` rules live in [`GO_LANDING_PAGES.md`](./GO_LANDING_PAGES.md)** — the route, the registry, noindex and no-internal-links, new-iteration-is-a-new-slug, and the shared analytics constraints. This doc covers the listicle format only.

## Overview

A listicle is a config object. You write the config, register it, and the route renders it. There is no per-page component to build.

Every listicle picks one of two **templates**, and its config type changes to match:

| Template | Renderer | Looks like | Reasons are | Use for |
|----------|----------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `mm` | `SimpleListicleRenderer` | Magic Mind editorial article | photo + heading + body | broad, simple, copy-led pages |
| `im8` | `ListicleRenderer` | dense, proof-heavy | data-viz panels, stat bands, tables | evidence-heavy persona pages |

The template is a discriminated union: an `mm` config literally cannot set IM8-only fields (product-image hero, CTA, product block) and vice versa. TypeScript guides you to exactly the fields your template uses.

## How it works

The route resolves `config.template === "mm" ? SimpleListicleRenderer : ListicleRenderer`.
See `GO_LANDING_PAGES.md` for the registry and static-build mechanics.

- **Buy box.** `mm` always renders the home `ProductGrid`, whose cards link out to the PDPs. `im8` renders `ListicleProductHero`, the PDP hero (`ProductHeroV2` / `ProductHeroMobileV2`) wired to its own cadence state and the cart, so it adds to cart in place.

## Analytics

Three events, wired automatically by both renderers. Nothing to configure per page.

| Event | Fires | Properties |
|-------|-------|------------|
| `listicle:section_viewed` | Once per section per pageview, when it scrolls into view | `slug`, `section` |
| `listicle:cta_clicked` | On CTA click (or add-to-cart in the `im8` buy zone) | `slug`, `section` |
| `listicle:interaction` | On an interactive-block press: the ADHD symptom picker and the brain-ageing segment toggle | `slug`, `section` |

`product` means different things per template, because the buy boxes differ: on `mm` it is a click through to a PDP, on `im8` it is an add-to-cart. Compare it within a template, not across.

`section` is either a body block (`reason_3`, `buyBox_5`) or a fixed zone (`hero`, `bridge`, `sticky`, `product`). Block ids are `${kind}_${index}` over `config.body`, so **inserting or reordering a block changes the ids below it** and breaks comparability with earlier data for that page.

Exactly two properties per event, respecting the two-property budget documented in `app/lib/analytics.ts`. The CTA's position is folded into `section` rather than sent separately, so one query returns the whole matrix:

```
dataset=events by=["eventData/slug","eventData/section"]
filter=eventName eq 'listicle:cta_clicked'
```

`section_viewed` is the denominator for `cta_clicked`: without it a low click count cannot separate a weak section from a rarely-reached one. Divide one by the other to get a per-section click-through rate.

`listicle:interaction` is the active-intent signal (a self-identifying press, not a scroll-past). It folds the *choice* into `section`, as `symptom_<label>` (ADHD) or `segment_<label>` (brain-ageing), so the same grouped query works. Only presses fire, never the pre-selected default, so a toggle's default option is under-counted relative to the one visitors switch to. Wired in `ListicleRenderer` via `useListicleInteraction`; the `SymptomExplainer` / `SegmentToggle` components stay analytics-agnostic behind an `onSelect` prop.

### Attributing the purchase

Most listicle CTAs link out to a PDP, so the click and the eventual add-to-cart would otherwise be unrelated rows. Every outbound CTA carries an origin token, `?src=<slug>-<section>`, and the PDP feeds it into the `source` field of the existing `purchase:add_to_cart` event through `getPurchaseSource()`. No new purchase event.

`source` is the right field because it already means "where did this visitor come from"; `location` keeps its existing job of saying where on the PDP they clicked (`hero` / `sticky_footer`).

The im8 buy zone sells in place, so there is no URL to read: it tags `source` from context in the same `<slug>-<section>` format, so a listicle-originated purchase looks identical whether it closed on the listicle or on a PDP.

Two guards worth knowing about: the token is sanitised on read (anything not matching `^[a-z0-9_-]{1,96}$` is discarded, since a URL param is attacker-controlled and would otherwise pollute the dashboard), and PDPs self-canonicalise from the root layout's relative `canonical: "./"`, which resolves on pathname only, so `?src=` creates no duplicate-content risk.

The mm buy boxes pass the token to the shared home `ProductGrid` through an optional `linkSrc` prop. Unset, links are untouched, so the home page is unaffected.

### Tagging the order with the persona (SCRUM-1180)

The `source` above lands the origin in Vercel, but the Shopify order needs it too, so paid orders are filterable by persona in the Orders list. The origin rides through to the order and becomes order tags:

1. **Persist.** `captureListicleSrc()` writes `?src=` to `sessionStorage` on PDP landing (the three PDP pages call it on mount), so the origin survives a within-PDP navigation that drops the param. `getListicleSrc()` reads the live URL first, then falls back to the stored value.
2. **Carry.** `CartContext` writes the origin as a hidden, cart-level `_listicle_origin` attribute on every add-to-cart (sourced from `getPurchaseOrigin()`, exactly like `_fbp` / `_fbc`, so a later origin-less add cannot wipe it). The `_` prefix keeps it off the customer's checkout.
3. **Tag.** The `orders/paid` webhook reads `_listicle_origin` from the order's note attributes and adds `listicle` plus `persona:<slug>` tags via the Admin API (`addOrderTags`), in its own try/catch so it never blocks the Purchase send.

Persona-only by design: the finer `section` stays in Vercel, keeping the Orders filter low-cardinality. An organic purchase (no `?src=` ever) carries no attribute and no tags.

### Implementation

`app/components/go/listicle/listicleAnalytics.tsx`: one shared `IntersectionObserver` for the page, handed to blocks through context. The slug lives only on the provider, so no call site can tag an event with the wrong page.

The observer itself now lives in `app/components/analytics/sectionImpressions.tsx`, shared with the PDPs (SCRUM-1260). It takes an `onSeen(section)` callback and knows nothing about event names, so each surface keeps its own event shape. This file is the listicle's thin wrapper over it, and the emitted stream is unchanged: same event names, same two properties, same `threshold: 0` and `rootMargin: "0px 0px -15% 0px"`, same once-per-section unobserve. **Do not change those observer options** without accepting that every historical `section_viewed` count is silently rebased.

The PDP side deliberately did NOT copy the index-derived id scheme described above. It keys on each section's semantic id instead, because the product pages are reordered often enough that positional ids would invalidate the dataset on the first reorder. See `trackPdpSectionViewed` in `app/lib/analytics.ts`. `mm` buy boxes use click delegation so the shared home `ProductGrid` needs no tracking props; the `im8` buy zone fires on add-to-cart instead, because delegating there would count cadence toggles and accordions as CTA clicks.

The attribution design shipped under SCRUM-1177 / SCRUM-1178; its plan doc has been folded into this one.

## Key files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `app/lib/landings/listicle-types.ts` | The config types. `ListicleConfig = Im8ListicleConfig \| MmListicleConfig` over a shared `ListicleBase`. |
| `app/lib/landings/index.ts` | The registry. Add your config here. |
| `app/lib/landings/general-listicle.ts` | **The `mm` model config.** Copy this to start an MM page. |
| `app/lib/landings/{adhd,productivity,brain-ageing}-listicle.ts` | **The `im8` model configs.** Copy one to start an IM8 page. |
| `app/components/go/listicle/SimpleListicleRenderer.tsx` | Renders `mm`. |
| `app/components/go/listicle/ListicleRenderer.tsx` | Renders `im8`. |
| `app/go/[slug]/page.tsx` | Route: slug -> config -> renderer. |

## Create a listicle (the whole process)

1. **Copy the closest model** into a new file, e.g. `app/lib/landings/my-page.ts`. Use `general-listicle.ts` for `mm`, a persona file for `im8`.
2. **Set the identity fields:** `slug` (the URL: `/go/<slug>`), `persona` (analytics tag), `template`, `title` (page title + Meta content name).
3. **Write the hero and body** (see the template reference below). Put any new images under `public/`.
4. **Register it** in `index.ts`: import the config and add `[myConfig.slug]: myConfig` to `registry`.
5. **Build.** `npm run build`. The build fails on an unknown `faqId`, so this is your safety net.

That is the whole thing. No route, component, or analytics wiring to touch.

## Shared fields (both templates)

`slug`, `persona`, `format: "listicle"`, `template`, `title`, `faqIds`, an optional `proof` object, plus `stickyBar` (`{ cta }`).

- `stickyBar` carries **only the CTA label**. Since SCRUM-1322 the bar states the
  offer itself, in two lines: the **quarterly** per-shot price and the gift value.
  Nothing there is configurable, deliberately.
  - Price and gift value come from `getOfferPricing(product, "quarterly-sub")` in
    `app/lib/offerData.ts`, keyed off `product.productHeroId` so they always match
    what the page sells. **Quarterly, not monthly:** the bar says "as low as", so
    it has to quote the cheapest cadence or the line is untrue.
  - The gift value is `freeShotsValue` plus every gift RRP, floored to the nearest
    ten. Same sum the PDP gift stack and the cart upsell show, so all three agree,
    and flooring means the figure can never overstate what actually ships.
  - **No rating in the bar.** Proof already runs twice above it, in the hero
    micro-row and the logo band, and a third copy competed with the price on a
    two-line strip. The bar sells; the page proves.
  - **No savings green.** It earns its place as a badge on a white surface; as a
    bare 12px line on the navy tint it read as a second accent competing with the
    CTA. The gift line is navy, which ties it to the button, and the word "free"
    does the work the colour was doing.
  - The "with a subscription" qualifier is `hidden sm:inline`. At 390px the full
    sentence ellipsed to "+£110 of free gifts with a sub...", which lost the
    point of the line; the number and "gifts free" always survive.
  - Background is `#eef1f8`, the flat sibling of the hero's Neuro Blue wash, and
    the CTA takes `ConkaCTAButton`'s inverted contract (white fill, navy border
    and text, flipping to navy on hover) rather than the component itself: that
    component renders a mono uppercase label and an O-mark, which is clinical
    grammar on a Simple DTC surface.
  - `label` and `sub` are gone, and so is `hero.offerBadge`: the hero stopped
    rendering it in SCRUM-1320 and the sticky chip was its last reader.

  Do not add a price, a gift figure or a rating to a config. If the bar needs to
  say something new about money, it comes from `offerData`, like everything else
  that can be sold.

- `faqIds` are ids from `app/lib/faqContent.ts`, in display order. An unknown id fails the build. The `/go` surface strips claim anchors from answers, renders via `LabFAQ` with no image column and no hub link.
- `proof` is the post-reasons proof tier, rendered by `ListicleProofTier` for both templates. Four optional moments, each doing a different job, in fixed order:

```ts
proof: {
  logoBand?: boolean,                                   // partner logos
  ugc?: { title?, subtitle?, items? },                  // UGCMarquee band
  feature?: { name, credentials[], quote, image, imageAlt },  // one named person
  reviews?: boolean,                                    // ReviewRail + trust badges
}
```

  Omit a key to skip that moment; omit `proof` for no tier at all. The `feature` portrait **must** be a white-background cutout (the component dissolves the white with `mix-blend-multiply`); every `*NB.jpg` under `public/testimonials/athlete/` qualifies. Leave `ugc.items` unset to use the shared 25-still set: below roughly 12 items the band stops reading as volume.

## `mm` template reference

```ts
{
  slug, persona, format: "listicle", template: "mm", title,
  hero: { author?: { name, avatar?, updated }, headline, subcopy },
  body: [ /* reason and buyBox blocks, in order */ ],
  // shared proof + faqIds + stickyBar
}
```

Body blocks:
- `reason` — `{ kind: "reason", n, headline, body, citation?, citationHref?, asset }`. `asset` is always an image: `{ kind: "image", src, alt, aspect?, fit? }`. Use `fit: "cover"` for lifestyle photos.
- `buyBox` — `{ kind: "buyBox", headline?, subline? }`. A mid-list `ProductGrid` (the reference repeats the offer after reason 5). The end-of-page grid is the `#product` anchor.

The hero is text-only (no image, no CTA button); the sticky bar carries the persistent CTA.

## `im8` template reference

```ts
{
  slug, persona, format: "listicle", template: "im8", title,
  hero: { laurel?, headline, subcopy, socialProof?, cta, offerBadge?, priceAnchor?, trustPills?, asset },
  reasonsHeader?: { eyebrow, headline },
  body: [ /* the section-block library, in order */ ],
  bridge?, product: { headline, subline?, productHeroId?, whoItsFor? },
  // shared proof + faqIds + stickyBar
}
```

**The proof wall sits directly under the hero (SCRUM-1321).** `ListicleLogoBand`
renders once, between the hero and the reasons, tracked as the fixed zone
`proofWall`. It used to sit above the buy box, which only 8-17% of visitors ever
reach, so the institutional proof was invisible to most of the traffic. The navy
proof ticker that occupied this slot is gone: its claims duplicated `trustPills`
and it read as chrome rather than proof.

**The reasons block announces itself (SCRUM-1321).** `reasonsHeader` renders an
eyebrow plus the "N Reasons ..." title directly above the first body block,
tracked as the fixed zone `reasonsHeader`. It is **centred**, which is a
deliberate exception to the design system's left-alignment default: it is the
one place on the page that acts as a title card for everything below it, and
the reference lander centres the same moment. Everything else on the page stays
left-aligned. The block immediately below it drops its top hairline, because the
header is the separator.

**Numbered headings.** `reason`, `symptomExplainer` and `segmentToggle` all
render through the shared `ReasonHeading`: the counter sits above the title as a
quiet `text-black/40` eyebrow, and the title is solid black. The old inline
"01." prefix and navy title are gone, and with them the last im8 exception to
the Simple DTC heading rule. It exists because the hero H1 is now
a soft outcome line, so without it the list starts with no framing at all. Keep
its `headline` in sync with the config's `title`: they are the same promise, one
in the tab and one on the page.

**Both new zones are fixed renderer zones, never `body` entries.** That is load
bearing, not stylistic: `section` ids are `${kind}_${index}` over `config.body`,
so anything added to that array rebases every id below it and silently voids the
scroll-funnel history. Add page furniture as a zone; add content as a block, and
accept the rebase.

**The hero is a preframe, not a summary (SCRUM-1320).** It renders in one fixed
order: headline, subcopy, CTA, rating. The headline is a soft outcome line at the
Simple DTC display tier (`clamp(2.5rem, 8vw, 3.5rem)`), *not* the "N reasons"
list promise, which belongs to the reasons section header further down. The
subcopy is one educational sentence contrasting an outside-in fix with working
from within. There is exactly **one offer surface**, the CTA, which pairs the
discount with the outcome ("Save 46% on a calmer mind"). Proof sits *below* the
CTA so it reassures the ask rather than being spent before it.

On mobile the copy column comes **before** the asset; on `md:` and up the asset
returns to the left half. Two hero fields are not what they look like:

- `offerBadge.hero` is **deprecated and not rendered.** It used to be a green pill
  above the CTA and read as a second, competing offer. Only `offerBadge.sticky`
  still renders, as the mint free-shots chip on the sticky bar.
- `trustPills` is **dead config**: it is set on all three personas and typed, but
  nothing reads it. It used to duplicate the navy `ticker` marquee under the
  hero; that marquee and its `ticker` field were both removed in SCRUM-1321, so
  these trust claims now live only in the reasons, the sticky bar sub-line and
  the FAQ. Either wire `trustPills` up or delete it, but do not leave it typed
  and populated and unread.

The `body` array is a plug-and-play library. Blocks: `reason`, `statsBand`, `reviewStrip`, `symptomExplainer`, `segmentToggle`. An IM8 `reason` takes a rich `asset` (`kind`): `image`, `video`, `crashChart`, `researchBacked`, `measureTile`, `cognitionBars`, `scoreByGroup`, `dayEnergyCurve`, `focusBars`, `athleteQuote`, `ingredientGrid`, `statPanel`, or `placeholder`. Each maps to a component in `ListicleRenderer`; see `listicle-types.ts` for the exact fields per kind.

## `im8` zone anatomy

The eight zones the IM8 template was modelled on, top to bottom. Background
rhythm is part of the design: the listicle core sits dark, the purchase section
is a hard switch to light, trust / comparison / reviews run light, the cost
breakdown is a dark card, the FAQ is a full-bleed brand-colour block.

1. **Hero** — eyebrow tag, all-caps "N REASONS [AUDIENCE] SAY [PRODUCT] [OUTCOME]" headline, short subcopy, a proof/rating line, primary CTA anchoring to the buy section, single lifestyle asset. A row of anchor chips (one per reason) sits below as in-page nav.
2. **Reasons breakdown** — the core listicle. Each reason: number marker, category tag, all-caps *felt outcome* headline (not a feature), a problem-validate paragraph then a solution paragraph mapping named ingredients to that exact pain, one asset alternating sides. Static review cards weave between reasons roughly mid-list (a row of 3-4 quote cards, no carousel, no JS). The final reason rolls into a dark CTA card bridging into purchase.
3. **Purchase section** — hard switch to a light band, the `#product` anchor every CTA deep-links to. Left: offer card, certification badges, product imagery, thumbnail gallery. Right: buy box with rating, variant selector, an inline named testimonial, subscribe-vs-one-time radio cards, CTA, reassurance strip, payment icons, then Overview / Ingredients / How to Enjoy / What's Inside / Third-Party Tested. Purchase happens in place via `funnelCheckout()` — no cart drawer, no navigation between conviction and checkout.
4. **High-performer trust carousel** — horizontally scrolling portrait video-testimonial cards, "Rated Excellent" badge floating top-right.
5. **Them vs us comparison table** — ingredient rows, our column showing a check, "+X% MORE" and the clinical dose against a generic unnamed competitor. **CONKA constraint:** per-serving doses are fine to show; formula-share percentages are **not** (composition is secret). "+X% more than the leading X" compares to a competitor's dose and is fine.
6. **Review wall** — huge review-count headline, masonry grid of static review cards, "Show more" revealing more rows client-side.
7. **Cost breakdown** — a large dark rounded card: stacked savings claim, CTA, product render, annual-savings badge on the left; an itemised "Monthly Breakdown" of what the product replaces on the right, closing on a two-row total. CONKA equivalent is the shot vs buying citicoline, omega-3 etc. separately.
8. **FAQ + minimal footer** — full-bleed brand-colour, single-column accordion (~7 questions), "Explore all FAQs". FAQ questions are persona-specific per config, never generic. Minimal footer, and **no site nav anywhere on the page**.

## Copy standard for a `reason`

Derived from a teardown of Magic Mind and both IM8 GLP-1 variants (Jul 2026).
The tight IM8 variant is the model:

> **A listicle reason is a statement-titled, single-idea, ~60-word unit.**

- **Title is a statement, never a question.** "Protect Your Hard-Earned Muscle Mass", not "Do Brain-Training Apps Actually Work?". A question asks the reader to do work and reads like an article; a statement *is* a reason and reads like a list. Where a search question matters for AEO, put it in the `tag` eyebrow and keep the headline a statement.
- **50 to 80 words, one mechanism.** Open on the reader's specific pain in second person, pivot to the fix in one clause, at most one proof point. Push a second mechanism or extra citation into the ingredient grid, which exists to carry that detail.
- **Unbroken numbered spine.** Number every reason-type block in one run, including `symptomExplainer` and `segmentToggle`; leave interstitial `statsBand` / `reviewStrip` unnumbered. A spine that reads 1 ... (wall of text) ... 2, 3 is the failure mode.
- **Hero subhead leads with the problem**, not a product summary: the reader's pain or the gap nobody warned them about, then the product, in one to two lines.

**What not to over-correct.** Real PMIDs/DOIs under claims are a genuine trust
edge over both references, which cite little or nothing. The interactive blocks
(ADHD symptom explainer, brain-ageing segment toggle) are more engaging than
either competitor's static page. Keep both; the gap was word count and titling,
never the presence of evidence or interaction.

## Gotchas

- **Unknown `faqId` fails the build.** Deliberate: it stops a page shipping with a broken FAQ. Add the id to `faqContent.ts` first if it does not exist.
- **`mm` reasons are photos only.** The type enforces it. Put the file in `public/` and reference it as `/path.jpg`.
- **Do not register a scaffold.** There is no lorem-ipsum template file any more; copy a real model config instead.
- **Adding a third template?** Turn the route's `template === "mm" ? ... : ...` into a lookup map at that point, not before. Two templates do not need a registry.
