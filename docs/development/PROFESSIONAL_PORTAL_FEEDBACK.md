# Professional Portal – Feedback & Next Steps

Notes from B2B feedback. Each point can be expanded with more context as we work through them.

---

## 1. Individual orders and team orders only

- **Goal:** Use “team” everywhere instead of “bulk”.
- **Action:** Update copy on the team portal and team page to say **team** only, not “bulk orders”.

---

## 2. Individual protocol picker – layout

- **Goal:** Improve the layout of the individual protocol picker.
- **Action:** TBC – to be confirmed on how.

---

## 3. Align protocol options to bulk view

- **Goal:** Make individual protocol options behave like the bulk view.
- **Actions:**
  - Align pricing with bulk.
  - Simplify size: **28 shots per protocol** only (remove extra size options).
  - Allow incrementing **count** only.
  - Support **subscription** or **one-off** in the same way as `FormulaCard` (see `app/components/professionals/formulas/FormulaCard.tsx`).

---

## 4. Science page content on professionals main page

- **Goal:** Surface science content in the practitioner flow.
- **Action:** Place the science page content **underneath the two cards** on the professionals landing page (`app/professionals/page.tsx`).

---

## 5. Keep everything in the portal

- **Goal:** All practitioner flows and content live inside the portal (no sending users out).

---

## 6. Breadcrumbs

- **Goal:** Easy navigation back to the start of the practitioner experience.
- **Action:** Add breadcrumbs so users can navigate back to the starting page of the practitioner/professionals page.
