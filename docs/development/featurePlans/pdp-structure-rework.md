# PDP Structure Rework

> **Purpose:** Strip the three product pages back to the buy decision plus the arguments only CONKA can make. Phased so each phase ships to production on its own.

Phases 1 to 3 are merged and live (PRs #447, #448, #449), and the orphan cleanup with them (#451, SCRUM-1264). Phases 4, 5 and 6 remain.

## Phase status

| Phase | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Slim, reorder, and instrument | Merged (PR #447) |
| 2 | Comparison table | Merged (PR #448, SCRUM-1261) |
| 3a | Ingredients grid, badges and drawer | Merged (PR #449, SCRUM-1262) |
| 3b | Disclosure rows and desktop hero cleanup | Merged (PR #449, SCRUM-1263) |
| 4 | App section and glass slide | Future (asset-gated) |
| 5 | Start pack, and cut Explore | Future (blocked on bundle definition) |
| 6 | Athlete proof beat, merge and copy | Open, direction suggested not decided |

## Problem

All three PDPs (`/conka-flow`, `/conka-clarity`, `/conka-both`) run a dense Magic Mind hero and then a 13 section body that restates the same arguments:

| Argument | Times it appears |
|----------|------------------|
| Ingredients | 3 (hero text list, hero outcome accordions, body `ClinicalIngredients`) |
| Benefits | 3 (hero lede checks, `ProductBenefitTiles`, `FormulaBenefitsPillars`) |
| Risk free | 2 (hero accordion, `LabGuarantee`) |
| Absorption | 2 (hero lede checks, `AbsorptionBioavailability`) |

Three consequences:

1. **The mobile hero is too tall.** `ProductHeroMobileV3` ends with a whole ingredients section (collapsed list, three outcome buckets of accordion cards, who it is for, try risk free). That is the Magic Mind desktop pattern, which works beside a sticky image column and does not translate to a single mobile column. `IngredientBenefitLede` also sits above the buy panel, so a 2.25rem H2 plus a paragraph plus a check grid push price and CTA down the first screen.
2. **You cannot buy below the fold.** Both sticky footers are commented out (SCRUM-1171). `CROTestimonials` and `LabFAQ` are passed `hideCTA`. So a visitor who reads to the bottom has to scroll back to the top.
3. **The real differentiators are absent.** The app appears once, as a subscription bullet in `ProductBuyPanel.tsx:469`. Glass bottles appear nowhere in the component or lib tree. Meanwhile three sections argue absorption, benefits and a coffee comparison, all of which competitors also claim.

Reference for the last point: the Gray Matter PDP (`trygraymatter.com/products/brightmind-1`) runs a buy box plus roughly six blocks, with a three column comparison table doing the positioning work and goal filtered reviews doing the proof.

## Approach

Delete what repeats, raise the buy decision, and add only the sections that say something a competitor cannot copy. Shipped in phases, each independently deployable via Vercel preview.

**Design language:** Simple DTC (Tailwind radii, navy `#1B2757` primary, green `#1a7f4f` savings accent). See DESIGN_SYSTEM.md section 8.5.

Note: all three pages set `brand-clinical` on the root div while every component uses Tailwind radius utilities, which `.brand-clinical` does not affect. The class is effectively vestigial on these pages. Out of scope here, worth a separate cleanup.

## Target section order

Applied identically to all three PDPs, which share one order today.

1. Hero (badge, H1, spec, rating, gallery, buy panel with ingredients pill, lede, trust strip)
2. Certifications band
3. UGC marquee
4. Ingredients
5. What you'll feel (`FormulaBenefitsPillars`, unchanged)
6. What to expect (timeline)
7. Comparison table (Phase 2)
8. The app (Phase 4)
9. Testimonials
10. High performers (athlete marquee and carousel)
11. 100 day risk free
12. Start pack (Phase 5, replaces Explore)
13. FAQ

## Phase 1: Slim, reorder, and instrument

The high confidence work. No new assets required.

### 1. Analytics: section view tracking keyed on semantic ids

**What:** a `pdp:section_viewed` event firing once per section per pageview, carrying exactly two properties, `product` and `section`, respecting the two property budget in `app/lib/analytics.ts`.

`section` is the semantic `id` already present on every `<section>` in the three pages (`hero`, `ingredients`, `guarantee`, `athletes` and so on). It is deliberately **not** positional. `docs/features/LISTICLE_SYSTEM.md` line 42 records the failure mode being avoided: listicle block ids are `${kind}_${index}`, so inserting or reordering a block shifts every id below it and breaks comparability with earlier data. This project reorders the PDP repeatedly, so positional ids would destroy the dataset on the very first phase. A semantic id survives reordering; a deleted section simply stops appearing and a new one appears under a new id.

Ship this first so Phase 1's own before and after is measurable.

**Extraction, and the backward compatibility constraint.** The `IntersectionObserver` machinery in `app/components/go/listicle/listicleAnalytics.tsx` is already exactly what the PDP needs, so it is extracted into a shared provider rather than duplicated. The extraction is **strictly behaviour preserving for the listicle**: the listicle keeps the same event names, the same two properties, the same once per section semantics, the same `threshold: 0` and `rootMargin: "0px 0px -15% 0px"`, the same unobserve on fire, and the same handling of elements that register before the observer exists. Every existing listicle export keeps its signature (`SectionImpressions`, `TrackedSection`, `useListicleCta`, `useListicleInteraction`, `useListicleSrc`, `sectionId`, `SECTION`, `slugifyChoice`) so no listicle call site changes.

Shape: a generic provider owning the observer and taking an `onSeen(section)` callback. `listicleAnalytics.tsx` becomes a thin wrapper passing `(section) => trackListicleSectionViewed({ slug, section })`. The PDP gets its own thin wrapper passing `(section) => trackPdpSectionViewed({ product, section })`.

Verification before merge: a listicle page emits an identical event stream before and after the change.

- Complexity: Medium
- Files: `app/lib/analytics.ts`, new shared observer module, `app/components/go/listicle/listicleAnalytics.tsx`, the three PDP pages

### 2. Cut the mobile hero tail

**What:** remove the collapsed Ingredients `<details>`, `IngredientOutcomeAccordions`, "Who is it for?" and "Try risk free" from `ProductHeroMobileV3`. Surface the existing `IngredientListButton` pill inside the buy panel, which already opens a bottom sheet with the full list, so the label stays one tap away. Move `IngredientBenefitLede` below the buy panel so price and CTA sit higher on the first screen.

No ingredient data is lost: `ClinicalIngredients` in the body already carries name, class tags, render, one line benefit, description and key study, all from the same `ingredientsData`.

Desktop keeps its ingredient column. The sticky two column pattern works there and there is room. Phases 1 to 2 leave `ProductHeroV3` alone; Phase 3 converges them.

- Complexity: Medium
- Files: `app/components/product/ProductHeroMobileV3.tsx`, `app/components/product/ProductBuyPanel.tsx`

### 3. Thin sticky purchase footer

**What:** restore `StickyPurchaseFooterMobile` and `StickyPurchaseFooter` on all three PDPs, restyled to a single row of price plus CTA. The current mobile component carries a plan dropdown and a trust strip, which is what made it heavy. Restoring the footers also means restoring the `cadencePricing` lines currently commented out in each page.

Add to cart from the footer already tags `location: "sticky_footer"`, so funnel attribution needs no new work.

- Complexity: Medium
- Files: `StickyPurchaseFooterMobile.tsx`, `StickyPurchaseFooter.tsx`, the three PDP pages

### 4. Delete the three restating sections

**What:** remove `ProductBenefitTiles`, `AbsorptionBioavailability` and `LandingValueComparison` from all three PDPs.

- `ProductBenefitTiles`' three titles are the same three strings as `OUTCOME_BUCKETS` in `mmPdpData.ts` ("Mental performance", "Sustained energy", "Brain health"). Confirmed duplicate, not a judgement call.
- `AbsorptionBioavailability` argues a category claim rather than a brand one, and competes with the Phase 2 comparison table for the same job.
- `LandingValueComparison` is a landing page component whose CTA points at `/conka-both`, leaking the visitor off the product they came for. The comparison table replaces it and keeps the visitor on the page.

The components stay in the tree. Note after building: only `ProductBenefitTiles` is still rendered elsewhere (`app/page.tsx`). `AbsorptionBioavailability` and `LandingValueComparison` are now fully orphaned, since `CrashChart.tsx:140` mentions the latter only in a comment. They are left in place rather than deleted, but they are dead and a later cleanup should remove them.

**That cleanup has happened.** `AbsorptionBioavailability` and `LandingValueComparison` were deleted on 2026-08-26 (SCRUM-1264), and `ProductBenefitTiles` on 2026-08-27 once the home why-accordion had replaced its last render site. Nothing in this phase is still pending.

- Complexity: Small
- Files: the three PDP pages

### 5. Reorder the body

**What:** ingredients up, what to expect after the ingredients carousel, 100 day risk free after high performers. Same order on all three pages.

- Dependencies: task 4
- Complexity: Small
- Files: the three PDP pages

## Phase 2: Comparison table

Replaces the deleted absorption section. Needs no new assets.

Three columns, following the Gray Matter pattern, where the third column is the sharp one because it addresses the stimulant adjacent buyer without making a claim.

| | CONKA | Coffee and energy drinks | Rx stimulants |
|---|---|---|---|
| Energy duration | 4 to 8 hrs calm | 1 to 3 hrs jittery | Cannot sleep |
| No crash | yes | no | no |
| No jitters | yes | no | no |
| Zero caffeine | yes | no | no |
| Clinically dosed nootropics | yes | no | n/a |
| Adaptogens | yes | no | no |
| Informed Sport certified | yes | no | no |
| Tracks whether it works | yes | no | no |
| Glass, not plastic | yes | no | n/a |
| Money back guarantee | yes | no | no |

Two of those rows carry the differentiators, so both land inside a comparison rather than as bare assertions.

**As built, one row changed.** "Zero caffeine" became "No caffeine or amphetamines". Prescription stimulants contain no caffeine either, so the original row would have handed the third column a tick and undercut the comparison. There is a comment on the row data so it does not get reverted later.

**Decided and built 2026-08-27.** Every row except the first was a tick for CONKA and a cross for both others, which read as marketing rather than comparison. A twelfth row was added, deliberately outside the Phase 2 row list:

| On the high street | no | yes | no |

It is the only row CONKA loses outright, and it sits directly under "No caffeine", so the two rows a rival wins land together in the middle of the table instead of an unbroken run of CONKA ticks. There is a comment on the row data explaining the placement, as there is on "No caffeine".

**Why this row and not another.** The open item originally proposed "No prescription needed" (CONKA yes, coffee yes, Rx no). Rejected on review: CONKA is a supplement, so needing no prescription is self-evident and the row reads as filler rather than as a concession. Availability is the axis where losing costs nothing, because anyone reading the table is already on a DTC site and nobody chooses a nootropic shot for being stocked in every corner shop. Two other candidates were weighed and dropped: "prescribed and monitored by a doctor" hands the Rx column a credential CONKA cannot answer, and "kicks in within minutes" concedes speed, which is a genuine reason the stimulant-adjacent buyer reaches for coffee.

Rx is a cross on this row: a pharmacy sits on the high street, but you cannot walk in and buy the product.

The table is fully data-driven off `ROWS`, so nothing else needed changing: the closing decorative `<tr aria-hidden>` and the tinted CONKA panel terminate off the last mapped row regardless of count. It renders on four surfaces (home plus the three PDPs) and there is no column-width change, so the 390px behaviour is unchanged: the table still scrolls inside its own `overflow-x: auto` container and the page body does not.

Mobile: the table scrolls inside its own `overflow-x: auto` container. The page body must never scroll horizontally.

- Complexity: Medium
- Files: new `app/components/product/ProductComparisonTable.tsx`, the three PDP pages

## Phase 3: Ingredients grid

**Reshaped twice since the original scoping. Read this section, not the ticket history.**

The first reshape was mechanical: SCRUM-1255 (image-led ingredient cards) merged in PR #445 before Phase 1 branched, so `ClinicalIngredients` already had the card face this phase was going to build. Three card shapes to reconcile became two.

The second reshape came from new references (Reformed, `feelreformed.com`, plus the Gray Matter ingredient grid) and changes the shape of the work: **a grid of ingredient tiles with a benefit badge on each, replacing both the rail and the outcome-bucket headings.** The badge carries per tile what the three headings used to carry per group, which reads faster and removes a layer of structure.

Split into two tickets so the visible half ships on its own.

### The badge, and why it is two lines

The obvious data source, `ingredientsData.functionalCategory`, has only five values across the dataset and repeats badly: four of the nine Clear tiles would read "Neuroprotection". It is also too technical to lead with.

`OUTCOME_BUCKETS` already holds the layman vocabulary (Mental performance / Sustained energy / Brain health) and already maps every ingredient to one. So the badge is:

- **Line 1, the outcome:** from `OUTCOME_BUCKETS`, layman, deliberately repeats across tiles so the grid visually clusters ingredients by what they do.
- **Line 2, the mechanism:** short and specific, where technical is appropriate because it is a subheading rather than the headline.

Black Pepper sits in no bucket, being the absorption enhancer rather than an outcome, so it takes a fourth line-1 value: **Absorption**.

This keeps `OUTCOME_BUCKETS` in use rather than orphaning it, and it means dropping line 2 later is a one-line change if it reads noisy. Line 2 copy is unproven and expected to need iteration.

### Counts

`FORMULA_DISPLAY_ORDER` gives Flow exactly 6 ingredients and Clear exactly 9, so the grid is 3x2 and 3x3 at three columns.

---

### Phase 3a: the grid, badges and drawer

**What:** replace the horizontal snap rail in `ClinicalIngredients` with a grid of tiles. Each tile is a square render, the two-line badge over it, and the ingredient name beneath, with a `+` affordance. Tapping a tile opens a **side drawer** showing that one ingredient: large image, name, description, benefits-supported row, and the study link.

- **Columns:** 3 from `sm` up. **2 on mobile**, not 3: at 390px a three-column grid gives roughly 105px tiles, and a badge reading "Sustained energy" will not fit. The Reformed reference gets away with 3-up because it has no badge; the badged Gray Matter version is 2-up.
- **Drawer:** new component. Inherits the backdrop, z-index and dismissal conventions from `IngredientBottomSheet` rather than inventing them. That component stays: it is a bottom sheet listing *all* ingredients (reached from the hero pill), whereas this shows *one*. Right-hand drawer on desktop, full-height sheet on mobile.
- **Study link:** free. `ingredientsData` already carries `pmid` per study, and `IngredientOutcomeAccordions` already derives a PubMed URL from it.
- **Both:** keeps the Morning/Afternoon `FormulaToggle`, switching the grid between the Flow and Clear sets. Confirmed decision: one combined Flow-plus-Clear list was the alternative and was rejected, since AM/PM is the actual product story.
- **Flatten:** `INGREDIENT_PARTNERS` folding is dropped. Every ingredient gets its own tile. Folding one ingredient into another's card fights the scannability the grid exists for.
- **Drop the render block.** The formula render, name, tagline and grammage block above the rail comes off, on all three pages. The hero asset already carries the product shot. Note this also removes the "3,700mg active nootropics" figure from the PDP, which `docs/TODO.md` item 9 records as disputed and blocked on Humphrey, so losing it is not a loss.

- Complexity: Large
- Files: `ClinicalIngredients.tsx`, new drawer component, `mmPdpData.ts` (badge map), the three PDP pages

### Phase 3b: accordion stack and hero cleanup

**What:** a stack of four expandable rows under the grid, in the Reformed pattern (bordered row, label left, circled `+` right):

| Row | Copy source |
|-----|-------------|
| Ingredients | the written-out list, `getPdpIngredientList` in `mmPdpData.ts` |
| Who is it for | `WHO_ITS_FOR` in `HeroAccordions.tsx` |
| Taste | `faqContent.ts` id `taste` |
| How to take | `faqContent.ts` ids `how-to-take`, `when-to-take` |

All four have canonical copy already, so there is no copy dependency.

Then the desktop hero cleanup: remove `IngredientOutcomeAccordions` **and** the written-out list from `ProductHeroV3`'s left column, so desktop finally matches mobile and the PDP has one ingredient surface instead of three.

**This closes a Phase 1 regression.** Cutting `IngredientOutcomeAccordions` from the mobile hero also removed the "Who is it for?" block, which `WHO_ITS_FOR` feeds and which has no other consumer. It has been desktop-only since Phase 1 shipped. The accordion row is what brings it back to mobile.

- Complexity: Medium
- Files: `ClinicalIngredients.tsx`, `ProductHeroV3.tsx`, `HeroAccordions.tsx`, `faqContent.ts` (read only), the three PDP pages

### As built (3a)

Two decisions landed differently from the plan above, both during review:

- **Badge tint follows the active formula** rather than one fixed colour, reusing `rolePillClass` from `home/ProductCard.tsx`: `#f7edcb`/`#755b1a` on Flow, `#f7ddd0`/`#9a4526` on Clear. Same tinted-pill language as the Morning/Afternoon bands.
- **The drawer leads with `oneLineClaim`.** Once the tile carried only name and badge, and the drawer only description, the one-line claim had nowhere left to render and would have left the PDP entirely.

The drawer also focuses its close button on open and restores focus to the tile on close. `IngredientBottomSheet` has the same `aria-modal`-without-focus-management gap and was left alone as pre-existing.

`getIngredientBadge` degrades to an empty outcome rather than throwing, so adding an ingredient to `ingredientsData` without giving it a bucket cannot break the grid.

### As built (3b)

Two traps surfaced in review, both of which would have shipped as silent content loss:

- **The lede lives inside the outcome accordions.** Removing them wholesale would have taken the subline, description and green-check grid off desktop while mobile kept them, since mobile renders `IngredientBenefitLede` separately. `ProductHeroV3` now renders it directly.
- **Desktop never passed `showIngredientsPill`.** Only the mobile hero did, so desktop would have been left with no ingredient access in the hero at all. Both heroes now pass it.

"See all ingredients" was also folded into the Ingredients row rather than dropped with the accordions that carried it.

The PDP now has one ingredient surface on both breakpoints (the grid), plus the hero's bottom-sheet pill, down from three on desktop and two on mobile.

### What fell out as dead

Verified orphaned and recorded in `docs/TODO.md` rather than deleted in the same commit:

- `IngredientOutcomeAccordions.tsx`
- `INGREDIENT_PARTNERS` in `mmPdpData.ts`

**`getPdpIngredientList` is NOT orphaned.** The plan flagged it as possibly dead; the Ingredients disclosure row uses it. `OUTCOME_BUCKETS`, `WHO_ITS_FOR` and `DotIndicator` are all live too. The TODO entry lists all four as do-not-delete, since each looks dead at a glance.

## The Magic Mind teardown (source of the Phase 3 direction)

Absorbed from `pdp-mm-upgrades-flow.md`, which this plan supersedes. Recorded
because it is the argument behind Phase 3's shape, not just an inspiration
credit.

**The diagnosis.** Post-SCRUM-1171 the hero was Simple DTC, but the PDP still
had three problems Magic Mind's PDP did not: per-card fine print repeated on
every plan (tall and busy), no single summary of what the chosen subscription
actually delivers, and below-fold education spread across **two overlapping
components** (`FormulaBenefitsPillars` + `ClinicalIngredients`) in long prose.
MM's page is faster to read and easier to scan on a phone, which matters because
74% of visits are mobile and paid traffic is the highest-cost segment landing
here.

**The single-browsable-ingredient-section argument.** Two competing education
sections make the reader choose where to look and repeat themselves in prose.
One browsable section keeps evaluators on the page instead of bouncing off to
research ingredients elsewhere. The shape: three outcome buckets as headings,
each a stack of ingredient accordion cards (icon + name + chevron), expanding to
a render image, a bold one-line claim, a short paragraph, and a "Studies
support" link.

First-cut buckets, taken from MM's categories:

| Bucket | Ingredients |
|---|---|
| Mental performance | Lemon Balm, Ashwagandha |
| Sustained energy | Rhodiola Rosea |
| Brain health | Turmeric (Black Pepper folded in as its absorption partner), Bilberry |

**The subscription summary card.** A card directly under the Add-to-Cart button
and the buy-once link (the MM position) that rewrites itself from the selected
plan: monthly reads "20 shots delivered monthly, first delivery 28 shots incl. 8
free, save 43%, cancel anytime"; quarterly reads "60 shots every 3 months, 80
first delivery incl. 20 free, save 63%". It derives from the same `cadenceData`
pricing the plan cards use (`getCadencePricingByProductHeroId`: `shotCount`,
cadence word, `firstOrderShots`, `freeShots`, `getDisplayDiscount`), so it stays
in sync automatically rather than being restated copy. Rendered once inside
`ProductBuyPanel` so it serves both the mobile hero and the desktop buy column.

Flow was the proving ground; Clear and Both follow once the patterns hold.

## Phase 4: App section and glass slide (Future)

Asset gated. Parked until assets are confirmed.

- **The app.** Its own section, image led. Needs app screens or a short screen recording. One line on measuring the effect rather than trusting it.
- **Glass.** Not a section. One gallery slide in the Functional mushroom layout (full bleed photo, small eyebrow, short headline, two short paragraphs), plus the comparison table row from Phase 2. Angle is preservation, not sustainability: light and oxygen degrade active compounds, amber glass shields them, so what is in the bottle on the last day is what was in it on the first. Confirm with Humphrey that our actives are light sensitive enough for the claim to be true rather than merely conventional.

Gallery note: ~~the Flow gallery already contains `ConkaVsOther.jpg` and `RiskFreeTrial.jpg`~~ **Resolved 2026-09-11:** the gallery was redrawn, and those two slides are now `FlowVsCoffee` and `FlowGuarantee` in `mmPdpAssetsV2/`. The duplication with the Phase 2 table and the 100 day section is deliberate: the slide summarises, the section carries the full version.

## Phase 5: Start pack, and cut Explore (Future)

Blocked on the bundle being defined: contents, price, whether it is subscription first, and whether it replaces the current `monthly-sub` default in the buy panel. Those answers decide whether this is a PDP section or a change to the hero buy panel.

`ProductGrid` / Explore is cut **only once the start pack ships**, never before. Explore is currently the only Flow to Both path on the page and Both is the higher AOV, so cutting it early leaves a hole. The start pack does the same cross sell as an offer rather than a directory.

## Phase 6: The athlete proof beat (Not started, open)

Raised by Rudh 26 Aug 2026 after reviewing the shipped pages. **The findings below are verified; the direction is a suggestion, not a decision.** Whoever picks this up should feel free to solve it differently, and the copy in particular is a starting point rather than an answer.

### What is actually there

`/conka-both` renders two sections making the same argument, five sections apart:

| | `BrainFuelBand` (position 4) | `AthleteCredibilityCarousel` (position 9) |
|---|---|---|
| Headline | "Trusted where focus can't fail" | "Why High Performers Trust CONKA" |
| Subline | "By Olympic medallists, world-class athletes & entrepreneurs **on the days that matter most**" | "Olympic medallists, world champions, and international competitors use CONKA **on the days that matter most**" |
| Carries | 4 stats, a neuron video | 8 athletes, sport marquee, quotes, Informed Sport block |

The sublines share a clause verbatim. Flow and Clear render only the carousel, so this duplication is `/conka-both` only.

**`BrainFuelBand` is also stylistically out of place on a PDP.** It lives in `app/lander/sections/` with its own CSS module, so it sits outside the design system governing every other section on the page.

### What the components hold

`AthleteCredibilityCarousel` already balances breadth against depth, which is worth knowing before redesigning it:

- `AthleteSportMarquee`: 15 sports, the breadth signal
- a thumbnail roster of **all 8 athletes**, which doubles as the picker (how many, all visible at once)
- a feature card showing one portrait and quote at a time (depth)
- an Informed Sport block as the rational anchor

All 8 athletes have a name, sport, credential, quote and portrait. The roster strip is what answers "how many", and the feature card answers "what do they say". Those two jobs are already separated.

The four stats are the thing the carousel does **not** have, and the only real content `BrainFuelBand` adds: 75% improved cognitive function in under 3 weeks, 19.3% better focus in professional athletes, 89% saw an uplift in test score, 4 clinical trials.

### A suggested direction

One merged section on `/conka-both`, so the page makes the argument once:

1. Sport marquee, breadth
2. Headline and subline
3. Stats band, the four numbers moved across from `BrainFuelBand`
4. Roster strip, 8 faces, picker
5. Feature card, portrait and quote
6. Informed Sport anchor

The idea is breadth, then hard numbers, then faces, then a human voice, then certification, with each layer answering a different objection and nothing said twice. That ordering is a guess at what reads well and has not been tested.

### Copy

"Trusted where focus can't fail" was flagged as weak. It is abstract, names nobody, and describes the situation rather than the product. "Why High Performers Trust CONKA" is stronger but still generic.

Starting points only, all unproven:

- "Olympic medallists. World champions. Same shot."
- "The people who cannot afford a bad day"
- "Informed Sport certified, because their careers depend on it"

The third turns the certification into the reason rather than a badge, which is arguably the strongest available angle, but it is a hypothesis.

### The one firm constraint

**Do not delete `BrainFuelBand`.** It is also rendered by `app/page.tsx`, `app/lander/page.tsx` and `app/(trial-b)/lander-b/page.tsx`. Removing it from `/conka-both` means removing the `brainFuelSection` reference from that page only.

### Also easy, unrelated to the above

The FAQ's sticky lifestyle image was flagged as unnecessary. `LabFAQ` already accepts `image={null}`, which drops the column and runs the questions full width; the `/go` listicles do exactly this. One prop on three pages.

## Rabbit holes

- **The ingredients grid (3a).** One data source, three pages, a new drawer, and `/conka-both` needs a two formula mode. Circuit breaker: if 3a runs past a day and a half, ship it without the drawer (tiles expanding inline via `<details>`, as the rail does today) and take the drawer as its own follow-up.
- **Badge line 2 is unproven copy.** Expect iteration. Built as a data map so the second line can be dropped or rewritten without touching the component.
- **The observer extraction.** It touches a live, working analytics surface. Keep it mechanical, keep both event senders separate, and verify the listicle event stream is unchanged before merging.

## No-gos

- Not touching `FormulaBenefitsPillars`. It keeps its stats and stays a section.
- Not converting "what you'll feel" into a gallery slide.
- Not making glass its own section.
- Not removing the vestigial `brand-clinical` root class.
- Not diverging the three PDPs. They share one order today and keep sharing one.
- Not changing routes, metadata or URLs.

## Risks

- Deleting sections changes on page H2 hierarchy. Confirm no heading skips and that PDP JSON-LD is unaffected.
- Phase 1 temporarily loses the three outcome bucket subheads until Phase 3 returns them. Reversible, and no ingredient data is lost.
- Phase 1 leaves a gap where absorption was until Phase 2 lands, roughly a day.
- Section view tracking ships in the same phase as the changes, so there is no pre change baseline. Accepted: waiting a fortnight to gather one is worse than shipping.
- The listicle analytics extraction is the only change in this plan that can break something already earning money. Treat its verification as a merge gate.

## Jira tickets

Sprint 30, epic SCRUM-763 (Website & CRO). Active phases only; Phases 4 and 5 stay in this doc until they are unblocked.

| Ticket | Title | Phase | Status |
|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| SCRUM-1260 | PDP Phase 1: slim the mobile hero, restore a thin sticky footer, delete duplicate sections, add section tracking | 1 | To Do |
| SCRUM-1261 | PDP Phase 2: three column comparison table (CONKA vs coffee vs Rx stimulants) | 2 | To Do |
| SCRUM-1262 | PDP Phase 3: merge the two ingredient surfaces into one outcome grouped section | 3 | To Do |

SCRUM-1260 blocks both SCRUM-1261 and SCRUM-1262.

SCRUM-1262 relates to **SCRUM-1255** (image led ingredient cards for the FMC renders). That concern is now closed: 1255 merged in PR #445 before Phase 1 branched, so its card design is already the baseline Phase 3 builds on. Nothing to fold or sequence.

Phase 2 was built on `feature/pdp-comparison-table`, branched off main after Phase 1 merged.
