# Landing Page Claims Compliance Log

> **Last updated:** 2026-04-13
> **Context:** Marketing/compliance review identified non-compliant health claims on `/start` landing page. Changes required under UK/EU food supplement regulations (EFSA 1924/2006, FIC 1169/2011).
> **Scope:** Landing page (`/start`) + shared components used on landing page. This log feeds into main site updates later.
>
> **⚠️ 2026-04-13 update — ingredient dosages:** Items referencing specific mg values (Lemon Balm 300mg, Ashwagandha 600mg, Glutathione 250mg, etc.) are based on older research-dose figures and are **incorrect** against the formulation spec supplied 2026-04-13. Actual per-shot doses are: Lemon Balm 1,500mg, Ashwagandha 1,500mg, Glutathione 500mg, Vitamin C 2,500mg, Vitamin B12 1.5mg. See [FORMULATION_SPEC.md](../product/FORMULATION_SPEC.md) for the authoritative per-shot values. Decision pending on whether landing page shows mg at all (scientist advises no mg on herbals).

#### Phase 1: Benefit titles + ingredient subtitles redesign (2026-04-07, SCRUM-850)

Approach: Keep benefit titles (conversion value) but move ingredient names + dosages to subtitle. Benefit title is a standalone concept, not directly attributed to the ingredient -- reducing AMBER risk while keeping conversion power.

### Phase D: LandingWhatItDoes.tsx copy refresh (2026-04-13)

| # | Old Text | New Text | Reason | Anchor | Status |
|---|----------|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| 44 | Title: `What CONKA does.` | `Daily habit. Lifelong benefits.` | Magic Mind habit framing per Johnny feedback; no claim | — | Done |
| 45 | Tile 1: `Clinically-studied ingredients for your daily focus and clarity routine. Stay locked in past 2pm instead of reaching for another coffee.` | `Stay locked in past 2pm without reaching for another coffee.` | Drop hedging; observational framing retained | — | Done |
| 46 | Tile 2: `All-day mental energy without caffeine, jitters, or crashes. Adaptogens help your body manage the demands of a full day, not just the first few hours.` | `Mental energy that lasts the full day. No caffeine, no crash.` | Drop hedging ("help", "not just"); no change to claim surface | — | Done |

Vitamin C contributes to the protection of cells from oxidative stress.†† A daily routine built for the years ahead.` | `A daily routine built for the years ahead. Vitamin C contributes to the protection of cells from oxidative stress.††` | Tightened; retains EFSA Vitamin C claim + anchor | †† | Done |

### NEW: IngredientsPanel.tsx (Phase D — factual disclosure)

| # | Description | Anchor | Status |
|---|-------------|--------|--------|
| 48 | New native per-product modal launched from `LandingProductSplit` tiles | — | Done |
| 49 | Supplement facts table sourced from `docs/product/FORMULATION_SPEC.md` via `app/lib/supplementFacts.ts` — factual disclosure, no new claims | — | Done |

| 52 | **Explicit mg amounts removed** from both the data module and the panel. Ingredient order preserved — descending concentration is the standard supplement-facts convention, so relative quantity is still communicated. Competitive IP protection. Only %NRV retained on Clear's Vit C and B12 (required to substantiate EFSA claims). Also extended Ingredients modal trigger to `LandingWhatsInside` ProductMini tiles for parity with `LandingProductSplit`. | †† | Done |

### CaseStudiesDataDriven.tsx — metric label revision (2026-04-13)

| # | Old Text | New Text | Reason | Anchor | Status |
|---|----------|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| 53 | Tile label: `Change in test score` (for Total Score metric) | `Information processing` (Total Score), `Cognitive speed` (Speed), `Cognitive accuracy` (Accuracy) | Labels describe what the Cognetivity test measures, not a product-driven claim. Percentage still reads as change in that measurement. Pushes the line vs. the more cautious "change in test score" — net risk assessed as low given `^^` test-validation anchor and global disclaimer footer already in place | ^^ | Done |

## Main Site TODO (for later)

The following pages use similar claims that will need the same treatment:
- Homepage (`/`) — testimonials, case studies section
- App page (`/app`) — case studies section (already fixed via shared component)
- Formula pages (`/conka-flow`, `/conka-clarity`) — ingredient claims, benefit descriptions
- Science page (`/science`) — study citations
- Main site footer — needs standard food supplement disclaimer added
