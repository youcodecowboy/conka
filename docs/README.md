# CONKA Documentation Index

The single entry point to the `docs/` tree. Skim this to find the canonical doc for a topic instead of grepping. Each row links the doc and states what it is the source of truth for.

> **Also load `CLAUDE.md`** (repo root) for the working agreement: operating efficiency, git workflow, stack, key files, design-system rules, and the strategic direction (protocol removal, funnel/landing build).

---

## Start here

| Doc | What it is |
|-----|-----------|
| [`MASTER_CONTEXT.md`](./MASTER_CONTEXT.md) | High-level architecture + business context. Read first on any unfamiliar area. |
| [`development/CODEBASE_AUDIT_AND_ROADMAP.md`](./development/CODEBASE_AUDIT_AND_ROADMAP.md) | Current state + prioritised roadmap (performance, code quality, architecture). Read before feature work. |
| [`TODO.md`](./TODO.md) | Deferred-work / tech-debt tracker. Each item lists files, what unblocks it, and why it was deferred. |
| [`PAGE_NARRATIVES.md`](./PAGE_NARRATIVES.md) | Page-by-page story map + health rating. Find the weakest section to improve next. |
| [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) | Human-readable change log. |

## Product / SKU / Pricing

The most important cluster for anything touching products, variants, or money.

| Doc | Source of truth for |
|-----|--------------------|
| [`product/SKU_AND_SHOT_REFERENCE.md`](./product/SKU_AND_SHOT_REFERENCE.md) | **Canonical SKU + shot-count map** across all three product generations (funnel / legacy protocol / main-site formula). Reconciles the conflicting shot-count numbers and documents the account-portal shot/per-shot display history (why the tiles were removed). Start here for "which SKU / how many shots / what price". |
| [`product/PRODUCT_DATA.md`](./product/PRODUCT_DATA.md) | How the product-data **code** is organised: the two systems (main site barrel vs funnel), module dependency graph, where Shopify GIDs live. |
| [`product/FORMULATION_SPEC.md`](./product/FORMULATION_SPEC.md) | Physical formulation: per-shot doses, ingredients, %NRV, nutrition-label data for Flow (01) and Clear (02). |
| [`product/LOOX_PRODUCT_IDS_AND_SHOPIFY.md`](./product/LOOX_PRODUCT_IDS_AND_SHOPIFY.md) | Loox → Shopify product-ID mapping for reviews. |
| [`PRICING_HISTORY.md`](./PRICING_HISTORY.md) | Dated audit log of funnel price changes. Append a block on every price change. |
| [`development/CART_PRICING_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md`](./development/CART_PRICING_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md) | Rule: pre-add UI prices from `offerData.ts`; cart/checkout prices from Shopify only. |

**Code source of truth:** `app/lib/offerData.ts` (the offer catalogue, read by every selling surface), `app/lib/shopifyProductMapping.ts` + `app/lib/productData.ts` barrel (main site), `app/lib/legacy/protocolSubscriptions.ts` (retired protocols, live for existing subscribers).
