## Overview

### What We're Tracking

**Conversion Funnel:**
```
Discovery → Landing → Quiz (optional) → Results → Product View → Add to Cart → Checkout
```

**Key Areas:**
1. **Quiz Journey** - Measure quiz effectiveness and conversion
2. **Navigation** - Understand how users discover products
3. **Product Pages** - Track engagement and preference patterns
4. **Purchase Intent** - Monitor conversion funnel
5. **Content Engagement** - Identify what drives decisions

### Why This Matters

**Business Questions We'll Answer:**
- Does the quiz drive purchases? What's the conversion rate?
- Which products/protocols convert best?
- Where do users drop off in the funnel?
- Which navigation paths drive the most conversions?
- What content sections drive engagement?
- Subscription vs one-time purchase preferences?

**Decision-Making Value:**
- Optimize quiz flow and questions
- Improve navigation UX
- A/B test product pages
- Optimize pricing/pack size strategy
- Identify content that converts

## Rollout map (phases → states)

This guide is designed to be **shipped incrementally**. Each phase is broken into **states** so you can always answer:
- **What do we do next?**
- **What do we learn immediately?**
- **When is this “done enough” to move on?**

### How to use this map

- If you’re unsure what to implement next, pick the **highest phase** where you’re not yet at State C.
- If you need to diagnose drop-off, prioritize states marked **(diagnostics)**.
- If you need to improve conversion rate quickly, prioritize states marked **(conversion)**.

### Current recommendation order (most DTC-impact first)

**Phase 1 (Quiz funnel)** → **Phase 4 (Add-to-cart + cart view)** → **Phase 2 (Navigation)** → **Phase 3 (Product page engagement)** → **Phase 5 (Content)**

### Rollout checklist (tick as you ship)

- **Phase 1A (conversion)**: Quiz start → complete → results viewed
- **Phase 1B (conversion)**: Results CTAs clicked
- **Phase 1C (diagnostics)**: Question-level drop-off / time-per-question

- **Phase 4A (conversion)**: Add to cart (with product context + source)
- **Phase 4B (conversion)**: Cart viewed / opened
- **Phase 4C (diagnostics)**: Option selection → add-to-cart attribution

- **Phase 2A (discovery)**: Shop menu opened
- **Phase 2B (discovery)**: Shop menu section hover
- **Phase 2C (discovery/conversion)**: Shop menu item click + CTA clicks

- **Phase 3A (baseline)**: Product page view (formula + protocol)
- **Phase 3B (conversion support)**: Product option selected (tier/pack/purchase type)
- **Phase 3C (diagnostics)**: Section viewed (scroll depth / content engagement)

- **Phase 5A (diagnostics)**: Key component viewed (case studies / testimonials / benefits)
- **Phase 5B (diagnostics)**: FAQ expand
- **Phase 5C (diagnostics)**: Testimonial/case-study view details (athlete / protocol mapping)

## Phase 1: Quiz Funnel ⭐ **START HERE**

**Priority:** Highest - This is your primary conversion tool

**Goal:** Measure quiz effectiveness and conversion from quiz → purchase

### Phase 1 states (ship in this order)

#### Phase 1A — Minimal quiz funnel (conversion)

**Do**
- Track **`quiz:started`**
- Track **`quiz:completed`**
- Track **`quiz:results_viewed`**
- Store and reuse **`quizSessionId`**, **quiz start timestamp**, and **quiz source** (so later events can reference them)

**You get (immediately)**
- Quiz start rate, completion rate, time-to-complete
- Results view rate
- Breakdown by UTM/referrer/source

**Exit criteria**
- You can produce a weekly chart of: `started → completed → results_viewed`
- You can segment those rates by **source** (quiz entry point / UTMs)

**Next**
- Go to **Phase 1B** if you want to improve results-page conversion
- Or jump to **Phase 4A** if you want to measure revenue intent (add-to-cart) ASAP

#### Phase 1B — Results → product intent (conversion)

**Do**
- Track **`quiz:result_cta_clicked`** for:
  - View protocol
  - Add to cart (if available on results)
  - Explore other protocols

**You get (immediately)**
- Which results-page CTA drives the highest click-through
- How long users spend on results before acting

**Exit criteria**
- You can report: results-page CTR by CTA type + recommended protocol

**Next**
- Go to **Phase 4A** (add-to-cart) to tie quiz → purchase intent together
- Or go to **Phase 1C** if completion is low and you need drop-off diagnostics

#### Phase 1C — Drop-off diagnosis (diagnostics)

**Do**
- Track **`quiz:question_viewed`** (and optionally Vercel-side `quiz:answer_selected` if you want *journey* reporting there too)

**You get (immediately)**
- Exact questions where people abandon
- Time-per-question and “confusion” signals

**Exit criteria**
- You can rank questions by: view count, abandonment, time spent

**Next**
- Use Convex (answers) + Vercel (drop-off timing) together to change copy/ordering/questions

#### Phase 4C — Option → add-to-cart attribution (diagnostics)

**Do**
- Ensure option selection events can be tied to add-to-cart in reporting (via consistent `pageId`, `pageType`, and session/source fields)

**You get**
- Which option changes are “good” (lead to add-to-cart) vs “confusing” (lead to exits)

**Exit criteria**
- You can compare converters vs non-converters on option exploration patterns

**Next**

  purchaseType: "subscription" | "one-time",
  location: string,                    // "hero", "sticky_footer", "results_page", "calendar"
  source: "quiz" | "menu" | "direct" | "cta",  // How they got here
  price: number,                       // Product price
  sessionId?: string                   // Quiz session ID if from quiz
}
```

**Why Track:**
- Measure conversion rate by product
- Identify which options convert best
- Calculate conversion by source (quiz vs direct)
- Track average order value
- Measure location effectiveness (where add-to-cart was clicked)

**Implementation Location:**
- `app/context/CartContext.tsx` - In addToCart function, after successful cart update

**Implementation Challenge:** 
Your current `addToCart` only receives `variantId`, `quantity`, and `sellingPlanId`. You need product metadata (formulaId, protocolId, packSize, tier, location, source).

**Solution Options:**
1. Extend `addToCart` to accept optional metadata object
2. Store context in component state before calling `addToCart`
3. Use a wrapper function that tracks then calls `addToCart`

**Recommended:** Option 1 - Extend the function signature to accept metadata.

- Source conversion: `purchase:add_to_cart` grouped by source

**Product Performance:**
- Conversion by product: `purchase:add_to_cart` grouped by productId
- Conversion by option: `purchase:add_to_cart` grouped by packSize/tier/purchaseType
- Average order value: Average price from `purchase:add_to_cart`

**Funnel Analysis:**
- Product view → Add to cart → Cart view → Checkout (if checkout tracking added)

## Implementation Notes

### Session Linking (Convex ↔ Vercel)

**Strategy:** Use the same `sessionId` in both systems to correlate data.

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// In quiz page
const { sessionId } = useQuizAnalytics(); // From Convex
sessionStorage.setItem('quizSessionId', sessionId);

// When tracking with Vercel
const sessionId = sessionStorage.getItem('quizSessionId');
trackEvent({
  name: "quiz:completed",
  properties: {
    sessionId: sessionId, // Links to Convex data
    // ...
  }
});
```

**Benefits:**
- Correlate Vercel conversion events with Convex detailed quiz data
- Answer: "Which quiz answers lead to purchases?"
- Answer: "Do users who spend more time on question X convert better?"

---

### Source Tracking

**Strategy:** Track where users come from at each stage.

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// When quiz starts
const source = document.referrer || "direct";
sessionStorage.setItem('quizSource', source);

// When viewing results
const quizSource = sessionStorage.getItem('quizSource');
trackEvent({
  name: "quiz:results_viewed",
  properties: {
    source: quizSource, // Where quiz was started
    // ...
  }
});
```

---

### Time Tracking

**Strategy:** Track time between stages for funnel analysis.

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// When quiz starts
sessionStorage.setItem('quizStartTime', Date.now().toString());

// When quiz completes
const startTime = parseInt(sessionStorage.getItem('quizStartTime') || '0');
const timeSpent = Math.floor((Date.now() - startTime) / 1000);

trackEvent({
  name: "quiz:completed",
  properties: {
    timeSpentSeconds: timeSpent,
    // ...
  }
});
```

---

### Event Naming Convention

**Format:** `category:action`

**Examples:**
- `quiz:started`
- `navigation:shop_menu_open`
- `product:page_view`
- `purchase:add_to_cart`
- `engagement:component_view`

**Benefits:**
- Groups events in Vercel Analytics dashboard
- Clear hierarchy and organization
- Easy to filter and analyze

---

### Property Naming

**Guidelines:**
- Use snake_case for property names
- Be consistent across events
- Use descriptive names
- Include units in names when applicable (e.g., `timeSpentSeconds`, not `time`)

**Examples:**
- ✅ `timeSpentSeconds` (clear unit)
- ✅ `productId` (descriptive)
- ❌ `time` (unclear unit)
- ❌ `id` (not descriptive)

---

### Error Handling

**Strategy:** Fail silently in production, log in development.

**Implementation:**
```typescript
try {
  trackEvent(event);
} catch (error) {
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") {
    console.error("Analytics tracking error:", error);
  }
  // Fail silently in production
}
```

---

### Testing

**Strategy:** Test analytics in development before deploying.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Events fire at correct times
- [ ] Properties are correct
- [ ] Session linking works
- [ ] Source tracking works
- [ ] Time tracking is accurate
- [ ] No console errors
