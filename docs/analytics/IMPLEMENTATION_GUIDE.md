## Overview

### What We're Tracking

**Conversion Funnel:**

```
Discovery → Landing → Quiz (optional) → Results → Product View → Add to Cart → Checkout
```

**Key Areas:**

1. **Quiz Journey** - Measure quiz effectiveness and conversion
2. **Navigation** - Understand how users discover products
3. **Product Pages** - Track engagement and preference patterns
4. **Purchase Intent** - Monitor conversion funnel
5. **Content Engagement** - Identify what drives decisions

### Why This Matters

**Business Questions We'll Answer:**

- Does the quiz drive purchases? What's the conversion rate?
- Which products/protocols convert best?
- Where do users drop off in the funnel?
- Which navigation paths drive the most conversions?
- What content sections drive engagement?
- Subscription vs one-time purchase preferences?

**Decision-Making Value:**

- Optimize quiz flow and questions
- Improve navigation UX
- A/B test product pages
- Optimize pricing/pack size strategy
- Identify content that converts

## Rollout map (phases → states)

This guide is designed to be **shipped incrementally**. Each phase is broken into **states** so you can always answer:

- **What do we do next?**
- **What do we learn immediately?**
- **When is this “done enough” to move on?**

### How to use this map

- If you’re unsure what to implement next, pick the **highest phase** where you’re not yet at State C.
- If you need to diagnose drop-off, prioritize states marked **(diagnostics)**.
- If you need to improve conversion rate quickly, prioritize states marked **(conversion)**.

### Current recommendation order (most DTC-impact first)

**Phase 1 (Quiz funnel)** → **Phase 4 (Add-to-cart + cart view)** → **Phase 2 (Navigation)** → **Phase 3 (Product page engagement)** → **Phase 5 (Content)**

## Phase 1: Quiz Funnel ⭐ **START HERE**

**Priority:** Highest - This is your primary conversion tool

**Goal:** Measure quiz effectiveness and conversion from quiz → purchase

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** (2026-01-23)

- Phase 1A: ✅ Implemented
- Phase 1B: ✅ Implemented
- Phase 1C: ✅ Implemented

**Implementation Notes:**

- All events track `sessionId` for correlation with Convex data
- Source tracking extracts from referrer and UTM parameters
- Time tracking uses sessionStorage for cross-page persistence
- CTA tracking includes location (results_page vs sticky_footer)
- Question tracking includes return visits and time-per-question

### Phase 1 states (ship in this order)

#### Phase 1A — Minimal quiz funnel (conversion)

**Do**

- Track **`quiz:started`**
- Track **`quiz:completed`**
- Track **`quiz:results_viewed`**
- Store and reuse **`quizSessionId`**, **quiz start timestamp**, and **quiz source** (so later events can reference them)

**You get (immediately)**

- Quiz start rate, completion rate, time-to-complete
- Results view rate
- Breakdown by UTM/referrer/source

**Exit criteria**

- You can produce a weekly chart of: `started → completed → results_viewed`
- You can segment those rates by **source** (quiz entry point / UTMs)

**Next**

- Go to **Phase 1B** if you want to improve results-page conversion
- Or jump to **Phase 4A** if you want to measure revenue intent (add-to-cart) ASAP

#### Phase 1B — Results → product intent (conversion)

**Do**

- Track **`quiz:result_cta_clicked`** for:
  - View protocol
  - Add to cart (if available on results)
  - Explore other protocols

**You get (immediately)**

- Which results-page CTA drives the highest click-through
- How long users spend on results before acting

**Exit criteria**

- You can report: results-page CTR by CTA type + recommended protocol

**Next**

- Go to **Phase 4A** (add-to-cart) to tie quiz → purchase intent together
- Or go to **Phase 1C** if completion is low and you need drop-off diagnostics

#### Phase 1C — Drop-off diagnosis (diagnostics)

**Do**

- Track **`quiz:question_viewed`** (and optionally Vercel-side `quiz:answer_selected` if you want _journey_ reporting there too)

**You get (immediately)**

- Exact questions where people abandon
- Time-per-question and “confusion” signals

**Exit criteria**

- You can rank questions by: view count, abandonment, time spent

**Next**

- Use Convex (answers) + Vercel (drop-off timing) together to change copy/ordering/questions

  - `app/conka-clarity/page.tsx` - Pass location ("hero" | "sticky_footer"), source ("direct" | "menu")
  - `app/formula-01/page.tsx` - Pass location ("hero" | "sticky_footer"), source ("direct" | "menu")
  - Other components calling `addToCart` - Add metadata where applicable

**Do**

- Track **`purchase:add_to_cart`** with full context (product, option, source, location)

**You get**

- The single most important DTC metric: **purchase intent** by product + source + option

**Exit criteria**

- You can answer: “Which product + option + source drives the most add-to-carts?”

**Next**

- Phase 4B to measure cart engagement and abandonment signals

#### Phase 4B — Cart viewed / opened (conversion)

**Do**

- Track **`purchase:cart_viewed`**

**You get**

- Add-to-cart → cart-open rate (a strong intent quality check)

**Exit criteria**

- You can report: cart opens per add-to-cart, by source and product

**Next**

- Phase 4C (if you want attribution from option-selection → add-to-cart)

#### Phase 4C — Option → add-to-cart attribution (diagnostics)

**Do**

- Ensure option selection events can be tied to add-to-cart in reporting (via consistent `pageId`, `pageType`, and session/source fields)

**You get**

- Which option changes are “good” (lead to add-to-cart) vs “confusing” (lead to exits)

**Exit criteria**

- You can compare converters vs non-converters on option exploration patterns

**Next**

- Consider tracking checkout initiation/completion (outside scope of this doc unless you add a checkout redirect event)

### Phase 4 events (reference)

### Events to Track

#### 1. `purchase:add_to_cart`

**What:** User adds an item to cart

**When:** When addToCart function succeeds

**Properties (8):**

```typescript
{
  productType: "formula" | "protocol",  // Type of product
  productId: string,                  // "01", "02", "1", "2", "3", "4"
  variantId: string,                   // Shopify variant ID
  packSize?: "4" | "8" | "12" | "28", // For formulas
  tier?: "starter" | "pro" | "max",   // For protocols
  purchaseType: "subscription" | "one-time",
  location: string,                    // "hero", "sticky_footer", "results_page", "calendar"
  source: "quiz" | "menu" | "direct" | "cta",  // How they got here
  price: number,                       // Product price
  sessionId?: string                   // Quiz session ID if from quiz
}
```

**Why Track:**

- Measure conversion rate by product
- Identify which options convert best
- Calculate conversion by source (quiz vs direct)
- Track average order value
- Measure location effectiveness (where add-to-cart was clicked)

**Implementation Location:**

- `app/context/CartContext.tsx` - In addToCart function, after successful cart update ✅ **DONE**
- Components calling `addToCart` - Pass metadata parameter ⚠️ **TODO**

**Implementation Status:**
✅ **Infrastructure Complete** (2026-01-23)

- `addToCart` function signature extended to accept optional metadata object
- Tracking functions implemented and firing automatically
- Product metadata extraction working (productType, productId, packSize, tier)

⚠️ **Components Need Updates:**

- Components currently calling `addToCart` without metadata
- Events are firing but using default values ("unknown" location, "direct" source)
- Need to update components to pass metadata:
  ```typescript
  addToCart(variantId, quantity, sellingPlanId, {
    location: "hero", // or "sticky_footer", "results_page", "calendar"
    source: "quiz", // or "menu", "direct", "cta"
    sessionId: quizSessionId, // if from quiz
  });
  ```

**Files to Update:**

- `app/quiz/results/page.tsx` - Has location and sessionId available, needs to pass them
- `app/protocol/[id]/page.tsx` - Add location and source detection
- `app/conka-flow/page.tsx` - Add location and source detection
- `app/conka-clarity/page.tsx` - Add location and source detection
- `app/formula-01/page.tsx` - Add location and source detection
- Other components with add-to-cart buttons

---

#### 2. `purchase:cart_viewed`

**What:** User opens the cart drawer

**When:** When cart drawer opens (isOpen becomes true)

**Properties (8):**

```typescript
{
  itemCount: number,            // Number of items in cart
  totalValue: number,           // Total cart value
  hasSubscription: boolean,      // Does cart contain subscription items?
  source: "add_to_cart" | "manual" | "auto",  // How cart was opened
  currentPage: string,           // Page where cart was opened
  timeSinceAddToCart?: number,  // Seconds since last add-to-cart (if applicable)
  cartItems: string,             // JSON string of cart items (productIds)
  isFirstView: boolean           // First time viewing cart this session?
}
```

**Why Track:**

- Measure cart engagement
- Calculate add-to-cart → cart view rate
- Identify cart abandonment patterns
- Measure time between add-to-cart and cart view

**Implementation Location:**

- `app/context/CartContext.tsx` - When setIsOpen(true) is called
- `app/components/CartDrawer.tsx` - On component mount (if needed)

---

#### 3. `purchase:option_selected`

**What:** User changes an option (pack size, tier, purchase type) on a product page

**When:** When selectedPack, selectedTier, or purchaseType changes

**Properties (8):**

```typescript
{
  pageType: "formula" | "protocol",
  pageId: string,
  optionType: "pack_size" | "tier" | "purchase_type",
  selectedValue: string,
  previousValue?: string,
  timeOnPage: number,
  source: string,
  location: string,              // Where option was changed
  hasAddedToCart: boolean        // Did they add to cart after this change?
}
```

**Why Track:**

- Measure option exploration patterns
- Identify which options lead to purchases
- Calculate option change → add-to-cart conversion
- A/B test option presentation

**Implementation Location:**

- Same as `product:option_selected` (Phase 3)
- **Note:** This is the same event as `product:option_selected`. Consider consolidating or using different event names for clarity.

---

### Phase 4 Metrics to Calculate

**Conversion Rates:**

- Add-to-cart rate: `purchase:add_to_cart` / `product:page_view`
- Cart view rate: `purchase:cart_viewed` / `purchase:add_to_cart`
- Source conversion: `purchase:add_to_cart` grouped by source

**Product Performance:**

- Conversion by product: `purchase:add_to_cart` grouped by productId
- Conversion by option: `purchase:add_to_cart` grouped by packSize/tier/purchaseType
- Average order value: Average price from `purchase:add_to_cart`

**Funnel Analysis:**

- Product view → Add to cart → Cart view → Checkout (if checkout tracking added)

---

## Implementation Notes

### Session Linking (Convex ↔ Vercel)

**Strategy:** Use the same `sessionId` in both systems to correlate data.

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// In quiz page
const { sessionId } = useQuizAnalytics(); // From Convex
sessionStorage.setItem("quizSessionId", sessionId);

// When tracking with Vercel
const sessionId = sessionStorage.getItem("quizSessionId");
trackEvent({
  name: "quiz:completed",
  properties: {
    sessionId: sessionId, // Links to Convex data
    // ...
  },
});
```

**Benefits:**

- Correlate Vercel conversion events with Convex detailed quiz data
- Answer: "Which quiz answers lead to purchases?"
- Answer: "Do users who spend more time on question X convert better?"

---

### Source Tracking

**Strategy:** Track where users come from at each stage.

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// When quiz starts
const source = document.referrer || "direct";
sessionStorage.setItem("quizSource", source);

// When viewing results
const quizSource = sessionStorage.getItem("quizSource");
trackEvent({
  name: "quiz:results_viewed",
  properties: {
    source: quizSource, // Where quiz was started
    // ...
  },
});
```

---

### Time Tracking

**Strategy:** Track time between stages for funnel analysis.

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// When quiz starts
sessionStorage.setItem("quizStartTime", Date.now().toString());

// When quiz completes
const startTime = parseInt(sessionStorage.getItem("quizStartTime") || "0");
const timeSpent = Math.floor((Date.now() - startTime) / 1000);

trackEvent({
  name: "quiz:completed",
  properties: {
    timeSpentSeconds: timeSpent,
    // ...
  },
});
```

---

### Event Naming Convention

**Format:** `category:action`

**Examples:**

- `quiz:started`
- `navigation:shop_menu_open`
- `product:page_view`
- `purchase:add_to_cart`
- `engagement:component_view`

**Benefits:**

- Groups events in Vercel Analytics dashboard
- Clear hierarchy and organization
- Easy to filter and analyze

---

### Property Naming

**Guidelines:**

- Use snake_case for property names
- Be consistent across events
- Use descriptive names
- Include units in names when applicable (e.g., `timeSpentSeconds`, not `time`)

**Examples:**

- ✅ `timeSpentSeconds` (clear unit)
- ✅ `productId` (descriptive)
- ❌ `time` (unclear unit)
- ❌ `id` (not descriptive)

---

### Error Handling

**Strategy:** Fail silently in production, log in development.

**Implementation:**

```typescript
try {
  trackEvent(event);
} catch (error) {
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") {
    console.error("Analytics tracking error:", error);
  }
  // Fail silently in production
}
```

---

### Testing

**Strategy:** Test analytics in development before deploying.

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Events fire at correct times
- [ ] Properties are correct
- [ ] Session linking works
- [ ] Source tracking works
- [ ] Time tracking is accurate
- [ ] No console errors

---
