# Listicle Performance Log

> **Living data log for the `/go/*` listicle landing pages.** Append a dated snapshot each time we pull Vercel Web Analytics; the JSON block in each snapshot feeds the dashboard artifact directly. This is the data home — the [2026-07 ad-spend sprint doc](../sprints/2026-07-listicle-ad-spend.md) is the narrative context.

> ## ⚠️ 2026-08-24 — routing correction: there was never a funnel epoch
>
> **Checked against git while pinning the CTA routing epoch for SCRUM-1242. The funnel framing below is wrong and was never true.**
>
> **What the code actually says.** Listicle CTAs have pointed at the **PDPs** continuously since **2026-07-24** (`b224d714`, "attribute listicle CTA clicks through to purchase"), which is when `withSrc(buyHref, …)` replaced the in-page anchor. The `PDP_HREF` map itself landed a day earlier in `76ffe504` (2026-07-23). A pickaxe search over the whole history of `app/components/go/`, `app/go/` and `app/lib/landings/` returns **no commit that ever put a `/funnel` href in a listicle**. So the claim below that "listicle CTAs were re-routed to the funnel (not the classic PDP)" from ~27 Jul describes something that never shipped, and there is no re-route date to annotate a chart with.
>
> **Live routing.** CTA → `/conka-flow` · `/conka-clarity` · `/conka-both` (by the buy box's `productHeroId`), with `?src=<slug>-<section>` appended. Hero, bridge and sticky CTAs all use it.
>
> **Attribution is path-independent, which is why it kept working.** `?src=` is read on landing and written through to `sessionStorage` (`getListicleSrc`, `app/lib/analytics.ts`), so `getPurchaseOrigin()` still resolves at add-to-cart time even after in-PDP navigation drops the param. `CartContext` (line ~181) writes it as the `_listicle_origin` cart attribute, which rides Shopify's hosted checkout onto the order. None of that depends on which page the CTA landed on.
>
> **Two knock-on corrections to the text below:**
> - "the old `?src=` → `purchase:add_to_cart.source` path … stays ~zero because the funnel skips the cart" is **wrong twice over**. The funnel was never in the path, and `getPurchaseSource()` returns the literal `"listicle"` whenever a `src` token is present. **Cause now confirmed (SCRUM-1244):** `purchase:add_to_cart` was gated behind a stale variant lookup that returned null for every live product, so the event almost never fired at all and `source` never reached Vercel. Fixed on branch `fix/add-to-cart-tracking-gate`; the path should populate from that release onward.
> - The **~1-in-5 floor is still real data** (6 tagged vs 25 Meta-attributed vs ~38 store-lift in week 1) — but its stated *cause* is wrong. The undercount cannot be "the funnel bypasses the cart". Note the floor is measured on `_listicle_origin` **order tags**, which come from the cart attribute set independently in `CartContext` and were therefore **not** affected by SCRUM-1244. So that bug explains the dead `purchase:add_to_cart.source` path, not this ratio. Remaining candidates for the tag-side gap: cross-device, come-back-later direct visits, the `myshopify.com` checkout-cookie split, and `sessionStorage` loss between landing and purchase. Treat the ratio as observed, the explanation as still open.
>
> **For SCRUM-1242:** no epoch annotation is needed for a funnel-to-PDP re-route. The only routing boundary worth marking is **2026-07-24**, before which listicle CTAs scrolled to the in-page buy zone rather than handing off to a PDP. Trends may be read continuously across everything after that date.

## What we measure and why

Three events, all keyed `{ slug, section }` (the two-property budget — see `app/lib/analytics.ts`):

| Event | Fires | Role |
|-------|-------|------|
| `listicle:section_viewed` | Section scrolls into view (once/section/pageview) | **Denominator** — how far people scroll |
| `listicle:cta_clicked` | CTA click (all CTAs route to a PDP) | **Conversion proxy** — every click is a PDP hand-off |
| `listicle:interaction` | Symptom picked / segment toggled | **Active-intent** — self-identification, added 2026-07-27 |

`section` values: body blocks are `<kind>_<index>` (e.g. `reason_3`, `symptomExplainer_0`); fixed zones are `hero` / `proofWall` / `reasonsHeader` / `bridge` / `sticky` / `product`; interaction choices fold into `section` as `symptom_<label>` / `segment_<label>`.

`proofWall` and `reasonsHeader` are new in SCRUM-1321: the partner logo band moved from above the buy box to directly under the hero, and the reasons block gained an eyebrow plus "N Reasons ..." title. Both are fixed zones, not `body` entries, so no existing block id was rebased and the scroll funnel reads continuously across the change.

**Timeline note, 8 Sept 2026 (SCRUM-1320 / 1321), not yet deployed.** All three heroes were rebuilt as a soft educational preframe: outcome headline in place of the "N reasons" title, the green "+1 week free" pill dropped so the CTA is the only offer surface, the rating moved below the CTA, copy above the asset on mobile, and new person-with-product photography on ADHD and Productivity. The navy proof ticker was removed. Read `hero` CTA rate and first-section retention against this date, not across it. Annotate the chart here when it goes live.

**Why CTA-click is the conversion signal (baseline):** every listicle CTA links to a PDP, so a click is the furthest-down-funnel action we could attribute to a persona. This holds for the 24–27 Jul baseline snapshot below.

**First-party purchase attribution is now live (from ~27 Jul).** Listicle CTAs were re-routed to the **funnel** (not the classic PDP). The funnel carries the cart-level `_listicle_origin` attribute (`<slug>-<section>`, set in `CartContext`) straight through Shopify's hosted checkout, so it lands on the **order** as a note attribute — first-party, per persona *and* section. This supersedes the old `?src=` → `purchase:add_to_cart.source` path, which stays ~zero because the funnel skips the cart (no `add_to_cart` event fires). Pull orders by `_listicle_origin` (query 6 below).

> **⚠️ First-party is a FLOOR, not the truth (learned 2026-07-31).** The `_listicle_origin` count only rides the funnel→checkout path, so it captures roughly **half** of the orders the listicles actually drive (~1 in 5 at the start of the trial; 51% by 21 Aug as more buyers rode the funnel→checkout path). It misses come-back-and-buy-direct, cross-device, and the checkout-cookie split (`myshopify.com`). **Do not read the tagged-order count as "what the listicles sold."** For *volume*, use **store-level incrementality** (query 7) and **Meta Ads Manager** (query 8); use first-party only for *which section closes*. Week 1 proof: 6 tagged vs 25 Meta-attributed vs ~38 store-lift orders — the truth is the high end. Full working in the *Incrementality & attribution reconciliation* subsection of the 24–31 Jul snapshot below.

> **Known gap — `persona:` order tags aren't writing.** The `orders/paid` webhook also calls `tagsAdd` to stamp `listicle` + `persona:<name>` on the order (SCRUM-1180), but the live `SHOPIFY_ADMIN_API_TOKEN` (B2B Invoicing app) lacks `write_orders`, so the tag write silently fails. Orders still carry the `_listicle_origin` note attribute (that comes from the cart, not the webhook) — so attribution works, but you must filter by the note attribute, **not** the tag. Tracked in `docs/TODO.md`.

## How to pull the data

Vercel Web Analytics via the Vercel MCP. Project **`conka-shopify`** (`prj_ngcTTAV2aYQsza3lhOV0TrcMTVzJ`), team **CONKA** (`team_RYAm8UuAbSGDfZz1cn0M4tgr`).

```
# 1. Traffic (denominator) — visits by path
dataset=visits mode=aggregate by=["requestPath"]  since=<start> until=<end>

# 2. Scroll funnel — section views per page
dataset=events mode=aggregate by=["eventData/slug","eventData/section"]
  filter=eventName eq 'listicle:section_viewed'

# 3. CTA clicks per section
dataset=events mode=aggregate by=["eventData/slug","eventData/section"]
  filter=eventName eq 'listicle:cta_clicked'

# 4. Interactions per choice (symptom / segment)
dataset=events mode=aggregate by=["eventData/slug","eventData/section"]
  filter=eventName eq 'listicle:interaction'

# 5. Purchase attribution via add_to_cart (~empty since CTAs route at the funnel — see note above)
dataset=events mode=aggregate by=["eventData/source"]
  filter=eventName eq 'purchase:add_to_cart'
```

**6. First-party order attribution (Shopify Admin API).** The real per-persona purchase signal since ~27 Jul. The read-only **attribution-audit** app (`read_orders`) mints a 24h token via a client-credentials grant against `SHOPIFY_CLIENT_ID`/`SHOPIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` in `.env.local`; then GraphQL `orders(query:"created_at:>=<start>")` returning `customAttributes` + `tags`. Filter to orders where `_listicle_origin` is set. **Do not filter on the `persona:`/`listicle` tags: they have never been written.** The `tagsAdd` call is denied because the token lacks `write_orders` (79 tagged-origin orders between 10 Aug and 2 Sept, zero tags), so `_listicle_origin` is the only working filter. See `docs/development/CART_ATTRIBUTES.md`. The origin token is `<slug>-<section>`, so persona = everything before the last hyphen (minus any `-listicle` suffix) and section = the last segment. Run it as a throwaway `node` script (reads a secret + hits Shopify) rather than committing it — the classifier gates that call, so run it yourself via the `!` prefix.

**7. Store-level incrementality (Shopify Admin API) — the real volume signal.** Because first-party undercounts ~5×, the honest volume measure is the store-wide lift. Same client-credentials token as query 6; pull all orders `created_at:>=<4+ weeks ago>`, bucket by week, and count **new-demand orders** = new subscriptions + one-time, *excluding* recurring renewals. Compare the trial week to the pre-trial baseline (~3 new customers / week); the delta ≈ incremental orders the ad spend drove. `new-customer` proxy = `customer.numberOfOrders == 1`. Assumes the listicles are the dominant new paid spend in the window — confirm before attributing the lift to them.

> **Renewal test CORRECTED 2026-09-02 (Skio cutover).** This query used to define a renewal as tag `subscription_order` without `first_subscription_order`, or `Billing cycle #2`+. **Those are Loop tags. Skio does not write them**, so the old rule silently counts every Skio renewal as new demand from 1 Sept 2026 onward.
>
> **Use the platform-independent test instead:** a renewal has **no `checkout_token`** (it never passed through Shopify's checkout), and its `app` names the subscription platform. A genuine acquisition always has a `checkout_token`, on both platforms and in the headless setup. This is the same gate the Meta CAPI webhook uses, so the two agree by construction. Note `checkout_token` is not exposed on the GraphQL `Order` type: read it from the REST order payload, or use `app { name }` plus `customer.numberOfOrders` as the GraphQL-only proxy.
>
> Do not re-key this on Skio tags. See `docs/development/CART_ATTRIBUTES.md` for who writes which order tags and why none of them should carry logic.

**8. Meta Ads Manager (per-campaign) — best per-persona signal.** The tag is too sparse to split by page, so read the three `Conka | TOF UK | * Listicle` campaigns directly: **Purchases**, **Cost per purchase (CPA)**, **Amount spent**, and always capture the **date range** + **attribution setting** (7-day-click / 1-day-view inflates the purchase count). Meta CVR = Meta purchases ÷ matched-window page visitors (a proxy — the numerator includes view-through / cross-device, so it runs a touch high).

**Always match the window.** Section events first fired **2026-07-24**; use same-window pageviews as the denominator or every rate is understated. Confirm the live window by grouping `section_viewed` `by=["day"]`. Meta windows and Vercel windows must be aligned before computing any CVR (e.g. Meta 24–30 ⇒ subtract 31 Jul from Vercel visitors).

## How to regenerate the dashboard artifact

The artifact is `listicle-dashboard.html` (built in the scratchpad). Its `<script>` holds two arrays — `funnels` and `cta` — that are a direct transcription of a snapshot's JSON block below. To refresh: pull the queries above, append a new snapshot here, paste its `funnels`/`cta` values into the artifact script, update the window/caveat copy, and re-publish the same file to keep the URL.

## Diagnosis: why Productivity retains worst (Jul 2026)

Productivity keeps only **17%** of tracked entries past the first fold, against
45% (ADHD) and 35% (brain-ageing). It still pulls the most raw purchases of the
three (6 in the 24-27 Jul window) but on middling CVR (1.0%): **the volume is
doing the work, not the page.**

**The cause is a message-match break, not weak proof.** Paid traffic arrives from
founder-driven Meta creative (two founders, Humphrey talking-head,
Olympic-training origin) selling an emotive personal story, then lands on a
clinical mechanism hook ("the 11am fog... it's a fuel problem"). That break
bounces people before any proof loads.

**Why the first fold is the lever.** On-page CTA clicks concentrate in the hero
and the persistent sticky bar, so the body reasons' real job is *retention*:
keeping people scrolling far enough for the sticky bar to catch them. Fixing the
first fold lifts the retention that feeds the sticky bar, so the same ad spend
converts harder. The clean first-party signal to watch is first-fold retention
(17% baseline); Meta-attributed purchases are directional only at this n.

**Constraints on any fix** (established by research, still true):

- **No founder-story block exists** and `quoteBand` was removed. A founder narrative has to be composed from existing pieces: `reason` blocks carrying a founder `image` asset, the `athleteQuote` asset repurposed for a founder quote, and the proof-tier `feature`. A bespoke founder block is net-new component work.
- **The hero renderer is image-only** (`ListicleRenderer.tsx` branches on `kind === "image"`). A founder *photo* hero is zero-code; a talking-head *video* hero needs a renderer change and a sourced clip that does not exist.
- **Assets on disk:** `/TwoFounders.jpg`, `/lifestyle/CreationOfConka.jpg`, `/lifestyle/GirlsLaughing.jpg`, `/lifestyle/ConkaAtWorkDesk.jpg`. No Humphrey/Harry talking-head still or solo founder video.
- **Story material is canonical** in `app/lib/storyData.ts` and should be drawn from there, not rewritten.

The reposition (founder-photo hero plus a founder-origin Reason 1) shipped
2026-07-27. Read the snapshots below against that date.

## Snapshot — 2026-07-24 → 2026-07-27 (baseline, ~3.5 days)

First data of the £300/day trial. Section tracking went live 24 Jul, so this is the first window with funnel data. `listicle:interaction` not yet deployed (added end of this window). Absolute counts are small — directional, not conclusive.

### Headline

| Persona | Visitors | Pageviews | CTA clicks | CTA rate | Reach 1st section | Reach product |
|---------|---------:|----------:|-----------:|---------:|------------------:|--------------:|
| ADHD | 713 | 796 | 51 | **7.2%** | 45% | 16% |
| Brain-ageing | 226 | 247 | 26 | **11.5%** | 35% | 10% |
| Productivity | 545 | 580 | 13 | **2.4%** | 17% | 5.5% |

- **ADHD** — volume leader (48% of traffic) at a healthy rate. The workhorse.
- **Brain-ageing** — best rate, starved of traffic (15%). Underfed; scale it.
- **Productivity** — 37% of traffic at the worst rate; 83% bounce before reason 1. Hero not earning the scroll.

### CTA clicks by section (visitors)

| Section | ADHD | Brain-ageing | Productivity |
|---------|-----:|-------------:|-------------:|
| hero | 21 | 10 | 4 |
| sticky | 21 | 12 | 5 |
| bridge | 6 | 3 | 1 |
| product | 3 | 1 | 3 |

Clicks concentrate in **hero + sticky** on all three pages. Body reasons drive scroll, not clicks.

### Scroll funnel — `section_viewed` visitors

| Section (ADHD) | v | | Section (Brain-ageing) | v | | Section (Productivity) | v |
|---|--:|---|---|--:|---|---|--:|
| symptomExplainer_0 | 318 | | reason_0 | 78 | | reason_0 | 91 |
| statsBand_1 | 255 | | segmentToggle_1 | 49 | | reason_1 | 60 |
| reason_2 | 219 | | statsBand_2 | 39 | | statsBand_2 | 54 |
| reason_3 | 200 | | reason_3 | 35 | | reason_3 | 51 |
| reason_4 | 191 | | reason_4 | 33 | | reason_4 | 49 |
| reason_5 | 172 | | reason_5 | 28 | | reason_5 | 42 |
| reviewStrip_6 | 152 | | reviewStrip_6 | 27 | | reviewStrip_6 | 39 |
| reason_7 | 146 | | reason_7 | 28 | | reason_7 | 37 |
| reason_8 | 127 | | reason_8 | 24 | | reason_8 | 32 |
| bridge | 117 | | bridge | 22 | | bridge | 30 |
| product | 114 | | product | 23 | | product | 30 |

### Interactions

Not tracked this window (`listicle:interaction` deployed at window close). First data expected next pull: symptom-picker presses (ADHD `symptom_*`) and segment toggles (Brain-ageing `segment_*`). Note the pre-selected default segment is under-counted (only switches fire).

## Snapshot — 2026-07-28 → 2026-07-29 (first first-party orders)

First pull of **first-party order attribution** (Shopify, query 6). CTAs now route at the funnel, so purchases carry `_listicle_origin` onto the order. Pulled 29 Jul AM; source = Shopify Admin API on prod store (`conka-6770.myshopify.com`), all orders `created_at:>=2026-07-24`, filtered to those with `_listicle_origin`.

### First-party listicle orders

| Order | Created | Value | Persona | Section | Cadence |
|-------|---------|------:|---------|---------|---------|
| #3701 | 2026-07-28 10:02Z | £42.54 | ADHD | sticky | Monthly Single Subscription |
| #3707 | 2026-07-28 16:03Z | £36.00 | ADHD | sticky | Monthly Single Subscription |
| #3711 | 2026-07-29 09:14Z | £135.00 | ADHD | hero | Quarterly Dual Subscription |

**Totals:** 3 orders · £213.54 · 100% ADHD · sticky ×2 / hero ×1 · all funnel subscriptions.

- Of 39 total store orders since 24 Jul, **3** carried `_listicle_origin`; **0** carried a `persona:`/`listicle` tag (tag write is broken — see known gap). No listicle orders dated 24–27 Jul: the funnel-routing + origin capture only went live ~27 Jul, which is exactly why the baseline above is Meta-only.
- **ADHD flips the ranking.** It was the *worst* persona on Meta CVR (0.5%) yet is the only one producing first-party funnel sales so far. n=3 over ~2 days — directional, not conclusive.
- **Section matches the click data.** 2 of 3 came via the sticky bar, 1 via the hero — the two zones that dominate CTA clicks in the baseline (§04). Body reasons still don't close.
- **Not yet computable:** per-persona first-party CVR needs funnel *entries* per persona over the same window (not pulled). Brain-ageing and Productivity had 0 first-party orders this window.

---

## Snapshot — 2026-07-24 → 2026-07-31 (end of week 1)

End-of-week pull. Source = Shopify Admin API (query 6, all orders `created_at:>=2026-07-24`, filtered to `_listicle_origin`) + Vercel visits by requestPath. **Ad spend doubled to £200/day per listicle** (£600/day total, up from £300) at ~4pm 30 Jul — too fresh to read (only #3726 and #3732 landed after it; 31 Jul is a partial day).

### First-party listicle orders (all 6 to date)

| Order | Created | Value | Persona | Section | Cadence |
|-------|---------|------:|---------|---------|---------|
| #3701 | 2026-07-28 10:02Z | £42.54 | ADHD | sticky | Monthly Single Subscription |
| #3707 | 2026-07-28 16:03Z | £36.00 | ADHD | sticky | Monthly Single Subscription |
| #3711 | 2026-07-29 09:14Z | £135.00 | ADHD | hero | Quarterly Dual Subscription |
| #3722 | 2026-07-30 07:20Z | £149.99 | Productivity | sticky | Quarterly Dual Subscription |
| #3726 | 2026-07-30 18:45Z | £135.00 | Productivity | sticky | Quarterly Dual Subscription |
| #3732 | 2026-07-31 07:00Z | £74.99 | ADHD | sticky | Monthly Dual Subscription |

**Totals:** 6 orders · £573.52 · AOV £95.59 · ADHD ×4 (£288.53) / Productivity ×2 (£284.99) / Brain-ageing ×0 · section sticky ×5 / hero ×1 · all funnel subscriptions.

- Of 61 total store orders since 24 Jul, **6** carried `_listicle_origin`; still **0** carried a `persona:`/`listicle` tag (tag write still broken — see known gap).
- **Productivity broke through** — its first two first-party orders, both high-value quarterly duals off the sticky bar on 30 Jul. Fewest orders, biggest baskets (AOV £142.50).
- **Brain-ageing = 0 *tagged* orders** all week. *[Superseded 31 Jul: this was misread as a red flag. Meta logged ~6 Brain-ageing orders and store incrementality confirms real lift — the tag just missed them. Brain-ageing converts best per visitor (1.10%) but its clicks cost ~3× ADHD's: expensive, not dead. See the reconciliation subsection below.]*
- **Sticky bar closes.** 5 of 6 orders came via the persistent sticky CTA, 1 via the hero. Zero from body reasons or the product block. Matches the baseline CTA-click concentration (§04).

### First-party CVR & revenue-per-visitor (matched 28–31 Jul window)

> **Superseded 31 Jul —** these first-party CVRs are floor values (~1 in 5 of real orders); do **not** quote them as the per-page conversion rate. Use the **Meta CVR + incrementality** in the reconciliation subsection below instead. Kept here as the record of the tagged slice.

Denominator = Vercel visitors 28–31 Jul (funnel-routing live; 31 Jul partial). CVR is a floor — only counts orders that carried the origin all the way through checkout.

| Persona | Visitors (28–31) | Orders | CVR | AOV | Rev/visitor |
|---------|-----------------:|-------:|----:|----:|------------:|
| Productivity | 375 | 2 | 0.53% | £142.50 | **£0.76** |
| ADHD | 889 | 4 | 0.45% | £72.13 | £0.32 |
| Brain-ageing | 299 | 0 | 0.00% | — | £0.00 |
| **All three** | 1,563 | 6 | 0.38% | £95.59 | £0.37 |

CVR is close across all three (0.45–0.53%), but AOV swings 2× — so **revenue-per-visitor** (not CVR) is the honest "which page makes money" number: Productivity earns 2.4× ADHD per visitor on its quarterly-dual buyers (n=2, thin).

### Week-1 traffic (Vercel visits, 24–31 Jul)

| Persona | Visitors | Share |
|---------|---------:|------:|
| ADHD | 1,863 | 54% |
| Productivity | 1,019 | 29% |
| Brain-ageing | 579 | 17% |
| **Total** | 3,461 | 100% |

### Scroll funnel — re-pulled (the Productivity rebuild paid off)

The Productivity listicle was **repositioned to the founder/exec angle on 27 Jul** (commit `2aaba16c`). ADHD and Brain-ageing were not structurally changed. So scroll depth is windowed accordingly: **ADHD/Brain full week (24–31 Jul); Productivity post-rebuild only (28–31 Jul)** for a clean read of the new page. Entry = Vercel visits; sections = `listicle:section_viewed` visitors (undercount vs Vercel, equal on every page).

| Page | Entry→first section | Reach product | Window |
|------|--------------------:|--------------:|--------|
| ADHD | 44% | 16% | 24–31 Jul (full) |
| Brain-ageing | 32% | 9% | 24–31 Jul (full) |
| Productivity **(new)** | **33%** | **18%** | 28–31 Jul (post-rebuild) |
| Productivity (old, 24–27) | 17% | 6% | baseline |

- **The reposition roughly doubled Productivity's entry→first-section retention (17% → 33%) and tripled reach-to-product (6% → 18%)** — it now out-retains ADHD at the deep end. This is the standout on-page win of the week.
- New Productivity section order (post-rebuild): reason_0 125 · reason_1 110 · statsBand_2 99 · reason_3 97 · reason_4 93 · reason_5 85 · reason_6 79 · reviewStrip_7 67 · reason_8 65 · bridge 64 · product 67 (denominator 375).
- **CTA-click matrix (§05) not re-pulled** — still the 24–27 Jul baseline, and it predates the Productivity rebuild. Re-pull if you want post-rebuild click zones.

### Timeline of key changes (now in the artifact)

`24 Jul` trial live £300/day + section tracking + CTA→funnel attribution · `27 Jul` Productivity rebuilt (founder angle) + order-origin capture hardened (attribution reliable) · `30 Jul ~4pm` spend doubled to £600/day (£200/listicle) · `31 Jul 2:30pm` all 3 listicles aligned to Flow-primary offer — CTA + product hero lead with Flow, not Both (PR #409) · `31 Jul` end of week 1 (this snapshot) · `2 Aug 6:40pm` Productivity listicle: added a "first week free" offer badge to message-match the free-week ad angle (green "+1 week of free brain supplements" pill above the hero CTA, "+8 free shots" sub-line under the sticky CTA); copy/layout only, no tracking change. · `3 Aug 11:30am` Same offer badge extended to the ADHD and Brain-ageing listicles (identical hero pill "+1 week of free brain supplements on your first order" + "+8 free shots" sticky sub-line); copy only, no tracking change.

### Artifact

Dashboard refreshed to end-of-week-1 (first-party promoted to the headline, revenue-per-visitor added, Meta baseline demoted to a reconciliation section): same URL <https://claude.ai/code/artifact/b69a0128-2f0f-4078-a91f-b58d5f8196c4>. The 6-order table and CVR/traffic tables are transcribed straight from this snapshot; the `funnels`/`cta` script arrays are unchanged (baseline behaviour).

### Incrementality & attribution reconciliation (added — supersedes the "first-party is the truth" framing above)

**Correction:** the first-party `_listicle_origin` count is a severe *undercount*, not the source of truth. It only rides the funnel→checkout path, so it misses come-back-and-buy-direct, cross-device, and the checkout-cookie split (`myshopify.com`). Do **not** read the 6 tagged orders as "what the listicles sold."

**Store-level incrementality** (Shopify orders, new-demand = new subs + one-time, excluding recurring renewals):

| Week | New-customer orders | New-demand revenue | Listicle-tagged | Total orders |
|------|--------------------:|-------------------:|----------------:|-------------:|
| 3–10 Jul | 3 | £532 | 0 | 20 |
| 10–17 Jul | 2 | £197 | 0 | 16 |
| 17–24 Jul | 4 | £274 | 0 | 20 |
| **24–31 Jul (trial)** | **34** | **£3,592** | 6 | 62 |

Pre-trial baseline ≈ 3 new customers / £334 a week; renewals held flat (14–16 → 20). Trial-week jump to 34 new customers coincides exactly with the ad spend. **Incremental ≈ 38 orders / ≈ £3,258** on **£2,202** confirmed Meta spend (24–30) → **CPA ~£58–71, first-order ROAS ~1.5×** (positive before any renewals; subscriptions recur so LTV higher).

**Three lenses on the same week:** tagged **6** (floor, ~1 in 5) · Meta **25** · store lift **~38**. Meta's 25 is *credible* — it sits just under the incrementality, not inflated. Trust Meta + incrementality for volume; use first-party only for *which section closes*.

**Per-listicle (Meta, 24–30, best per-persona signal):** ADHD 1,749 visitors · 10 orders · **0.57% CVR** · £72.77 CPA · £0.42/visitor · Productivity 956 · 9 · **0.94%** · £82.22 · £0.77/visitor · Brain-ageing 547 · 6 · **1.10%** · £122.39 · £1.34/visitor. (Meta CVR = Meta orders ÷ page visitors matched to 24–30; numerator includes view-through so it's a proxy.) **Twist:** Brain-ageing *converts best per visitor* but has the worst CPA because its audience costs ~3× ADHD's per click — an audience-cost problem, not a page problem. So Brain-ageing is *expensive, not dead*, not the "zero" the tag implied.

**Caveat:** incrementality assumes the 3 listicle campaigns are the dominant new paid spend that week (confirmed by Rudh). Pull scripts: `scratchpad/pull-listicle-orders.mjs` (tagged orders) and `scratchpad/weekly-orders.mjs` (weekly new-demand).

## Snapshot — 2026-07-31 → 2026-08-03 (end of first weekend at £600/day)

Pulled **3 Aug PM** (end of Monday, weekend passed). Sources: Vercel Web Analytics (visits + section/CTA events, new window 31 Jul–3 Aug), Shopify Admin API (query 6 tagged + query 7 incrementality, `created_at:>=2026-07-03`), and Meta Ads Manager (all three `Conka | TOF UK | * Listicle` campaigns, **24 Jul – 3 Aug**, screenshot from Rudh). Spend has run at **£600/day (£200/listicle)** since ~4pm 30 Jul — this is the first read of the doubled-spend period. Framed cumulatively (trial to date, 24 Jul – 3 Aug) since Meta reports the full window; 3 Aug is a partial day.

**Headline: volume roughly doubled at flat CPA.** Meta orders 25 → **54**, first-party tagged 6 → **22**, spend £2.2k → **£4.5k** — and blended Meta CPA *held* (~£88 → **£84**). Doubling the budget did not blow up efficiency. First-order ROAS compressed toward ~1.1× on the newest (still-maturing) spend, but subscriptions recur so LTV runs higher.

### Cumulative Meta view (24 Jul – 3 Aug, the volume + per-persona signal)

| Listicle | Visitors | Meta orders | Meta CVR | CPA | Spend | £/visitor |
|----------|---------:|------------:|---------:|----:|------:|----------:|
| ADHD | 3,410 | 21 | 0.62% | **£72.06** | £1,513.25 | £0.44 |
| Productivity | 1,595 | 17 | 1.07% | £89.24 | £1,517.10 | £0.95 |
| Brain-ageing | 1,032 | 16 | **1.55%** | £94.12 | £1,505.86 | £1.46 |
| **All three** | **6,037** | **54** | **0.89%** | **~£84** | **£4,536** | £0.75 |

- **Rankings settled, and the week-1 "twist" strengthened.** Brain-ageing is now the **best converter (1.55%)** and its CPA fell from £122 → **£94** as it accrued volume — *expensive, not dead*, and closing the gap. ADHD stays the cheap-clicks volume play (£72 CPA, lowest CVR). Productivity sits in the middle on rate but leads on first-party revenue (below).
- Meta CVR = Meta orders ÷ matched-window visitors; numerator includes view-through, so read as a proxy.

### First-party tagged orders — 22 to date (up from 6)

| | Orders | Revenue | vs week 1 |
|--|-------:|--------:|-----------|
| **Productivity** | 10 | £800.45 | was 2 — now the leader |
| **ADHD** | 9 | £551.47 | was 4 |
| **Brain-ageing** | 3 | £108.00 | was 0 — broke through |
| **Total** | **22** | **£1,459.92** | was 6 / £573.52 |

The 16 new tagged orders (31 Jul–2 Aug): #3737, #3739, #3740, #3743, #3744, #3746, #3748, #3749, #3753, #3754, #3755, #3757, #3758, #3759, #3760, #3761. Cadence is mostly monthly singles/duals with five quarterly duals (#3711/#3722/#3726/#3753/#3759) and one one-time (#3743).

- **Section split flipped toward the hero.** All 22: **sticky ×11, hero ×10, bridge ×1** (week 1 was sticky ×5 / hero ×1). The hero surge tracks the CTA-click data below and lands right after the **Flow-offer alignment (31 Jul)** + the **hero "first week free" offer badge** (Productivity 2 Aug, all three 3 Aug). Body reasons/product block still close ~nothing.
- **Tag capture improved.** 22 tagged vs 54 Meta ≈ **41%**, up from ~20% in week 1 — more buyers are now riding the funnel→checkout path the tag rides (plausibly the offer badge/Flow alignment). Still a floor, not the truth.

### Store-level incrementality (new-demand orders, excl. renewals; re-pulled 3 Aug)

| Week | New-demand orders | New-customer orders | New-demand rev | Tagged | Renewals |
|------|------------------:|--------------------:|---------------:|-------:|---------:|
| 3–10 Jul | 6 | 3 | £532 | 0 | 14 |
| 10–17 Jul | 2 | 2 | £197 | 0 | 15 |
| 17–24 Jul | 4 | 4 | £274 | 0 | 16 |
| 24–31 Jul (trial) | 38 | 30* | £3,341 | 5 | 19 |
| **31 Jul–3 Aug (4d, partial)** | **29** | **27** | **£1,842** | 17 | 9 |

\* The 24–31 new-*customer* count reads 30 on this re-pull vs the **34** published in the week-1 snapshot: `customer.numberOfOrders==1` is evaluated *now*, so week-1 first-timers who have since reordered drop out. New-demand orders (excl. renewals) is the reproducible metric; new-customer is a decaying floor. Renewals held flat throughout — the lift is genuinely new demand.

- **The doubled spend is sustaining/accelerating acquisition.** 29 new-demand orders in just **4 partial days** already approaches the prior full trial week's 38, i.e. the daily new-demand pace rose with the £600/day.
- **Three lenses (24 Jul – 3 Aug):** tagged **22** · Meta **54** · store lift **~60** (incremental new-demand over the ~4/week baseline). Coherent and ordered as expected (tag ≤ Meta ≤ lift). Trust Meta + lift for volume; first-party for *which section closes*.

### Scroll funnel — refreshed to the current window (31 Jul–3 Aug, post-rebuild + post-Flow-alignment for all three)

Reach-to-product: **ADHD 14% · Brain-ageing 8% · Productivity 7%**. Depth compressed slightly vs the small post-rebuild Productivity window (was 18%) — expected: 2× spend pulled in broader, colder top-of-funnel traffic, so scroll depth normalised down across all pages. Hero + sticky still do all the converting; the body is scroll, not clicks.

### CTA clicks — finally re-pulled post-rebuild (31 Jul–3 Aug)

| Section | ADHD | Brain-ageing | Productivity |
|---------|-----:|-------------:|-------------:|
| hero | **81** | 15 | 18 |
| sticky | 45 | 14 | **40** |
| bridge | 16 | 2 | 2 |
| product | 5 | 0 | 1 |

- **ADHD's clicks moved to the hero** (81 vs 45 sticky — was 21/21 at baseline); **Productivity concentrates on the sticky bar** (40 vs 18). Brain-ageing balanced. Consistent with the tagged-order hero surge.

### Timeline additions

`2 Aug 6:40pm` Productivity offer badge (hero "+1 week free" pill + "+8 free shots" sticky sub-line) · `3 Aug 11:30am` same badge extended to ADHD + Brain-ageing · `3 Aug PM` end of first weekend at £600/day (this snapshot).

## Snapshot — 2026-08-03 → 2026-08-10 (trial to date, second full week at £600/day)

Pulled **10 Aug AM**. Sources: Meta Ads Manager (all three `Conka | TOF UK | * Listicle` campaigns, **24 Jul – 10 Aug**, screenshot from Rudh), Shopify Admin API (query 6 tagged + query 7 incrementality, `created_at:>=2026-07-03`), and Vercel Web Analytics (visits + section events). Framed cumulatively (24 Jul – 10 Aug) since Meta reports the full window. Budgets are **no longer split evenly** — ADHD is now £300/day, Brain-ageing £200/day, Productivity £100/day (weighted toward the cheap-clicks workhorse).

**Headline: volume ~doubled again at a slightly looser CPA.** Meta orders 54 → **94**, first-party tagged 22 → **42**, spend £4.5k → **£8.5k** — blended Meta nCPA drifted £84 → **£90**, still under the £100 target. The efficiency spread widened: ADHD holds at **£73**, but Productivity landed **right on £100** and Brain-ageing has crept **just over to £109** as it accrued volume.

### Cumulative Meta view (24 Jul – 10 Aug, the volume + per-persona signal)

| Listicle | Visitors | Meta orders | Meta CVR | nCPA | Spend | £/visitor |
|----------|---------:|------------:|---------:|-----:|------:|----------:|
| ADHD | 6,147 | 43 | 0.70% | **£72.75** | £3,128.27 | £0.51 |
| Productivity | 2,291 | 25 | 1.09% | £100.32 | £2,507.96 | £1.09 |
| Brain-ageing | 1,986 | 26 | **1.31%** | £108.85 | £2,830.01 | £1.42 |
| **All three** | **10,424** | **94** | **0.90%** | **~£90** | **£8,466.24** | £0.81 |

- **ADHD is the efficient engine** — cheapest nCPA (£73) and cheapest clicks (£0.51/visitor), which is why it now carries the biggest budget (£300/day). Lowest CVR (0.70%) but volume more than compensates.
- **Brain-ageing still converts best per visitor (1.31%)** but its clicks cost ~2.8× ADHD's, so its nCPA is the worst and has now nudged over target. Its CVR eased from 1.55% (to 3 Aug) as more/colder volume came in — expected.
- **Productivity sits in the middle** on rate (1.09%) and is exactly on the £100 line; it still leads on first-party AOV/revenue (below).
- Meta CVR = Meta orders ÷ matched-window visitors; numerator includes view-through, so read as a proxy.

### First-party tagged orders — 42 to date (up from 22)

| | Orders | Revenue | AOV | vs 3 Aug |
|--|-------:|--------:|----:|----------|
| **ADHD** | 23 | £1,431.89 | £62.26 | was 9 |
| **Productivity** | 13 | £1,101.95 | £84.77 | was 10 |
| **Brain-ageing** | 6 | £289.99 | £48.33 | was 3 |
| **Total** | **42** | **£2,823.83** | **£67.23** | was 22 / £1,459.92 |

- **Section split:** sticky ×22, hero ×16, bridge ×4, product ×0. Hero + sticky still do essentially all the closing; the two new bridge orders (#3780, #3819, #3820) are the only body-block closes all trial.
- **Cadence (of the 42):** monthly ×31 (£1,476.90), quarterly ×10 (£1,283.94), one-time ×1 (£62.99). Ten quarterly subs carry nearly as much revenue as all 31 monthly ones — the quarterly duals remain the revenue engine.
- **Tag capture ≈ 45%** (42 tagged ÷ 94 Meta), up from ~41%. Still a floor — the `persona:`/`listicle` tag write remains broken (0 orders carry it; filter on the `_listicle_origin` note attribute, not the tag).

### Store-level incrementality (new-demand orders, excl. renewals = billing cycle #2+; re-pulled 10 Aug)

| Week | New-demand orders | New-demand rev | Tagged | Renewals |
|------|------------------:|---------------:|-------:|---------:|
| 3–10 Jul | 6 | £532 | 0 | 16 |
| 10–17 Jul | 3 | £237 | 0 | 16 |
| 17–24 Jul | 5 | £394 | 0 | 20 |
| 24–31 Jul (trial) | 47 | £3,878 | 9 | 23 |
| 31 Jul–7 Aug | 55 | £3,824 | 31 | 21 |
| 7–10 Aug (3d, partial) | 19 | £1,682 | 9 | 6 |

- Pre-trial baseline ≈ **5 new-demand orders / week**; renewals held flat (16–20) throughout, so the lift is genuinely new demand, not churn timing. New-demand pace has held at ~50/week across both full trial weeks — the doubled £600/day spend is **sustaining** acquisition, not decaying.
- **Three lenses (24 Jul – 10 Aug):** tagged **42** (floor) · Meta **94** · store new-demand lift **~110** over the ~5/week baseline. Ordered as expected (tag ≤ Meta ≤ lift) and coherent. Trust Meta + lift for volume; first-party for *which section closes*.
- **Caveat:** the new-demand classifier here is coarse (total orders minus billing-cycle-#2+ renewals), so it runs a touch higher than the whitelisted "new subs + one-time" method used in earlier snapshots. Directionally the lift clearly exceeds Meta's 94; treat ~110 as an upper-ish estimate, not a precise count.

### Scroll funnel — refreshed as a drop-off (31 Jul–10 Aug)

Normalised to a 5-step funnel (% of Vercel page **entries** still on the page at each step). The cliff is the **first scroll** — most visitors leave before reason 1 — after which the taper is gentle and consistent across pages.

| Step | ADHD | Productivity | Brain-ageing |
|------|-----:|-------------:|-------------:|
| Entry | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| 1st section | 43% | 41% | 30% |
| Stats band | 32% | 24% | 18% |
| Reviews | 18% | 13% | 10% |
| **Product** | **13%** | **11%** | **8%** |

- **ADHD retains best at every depth**; Brain-ageing loses 70% on the first scroll (vs ADHD's 57%). Hero + sticky continue to do the converting, so low reach is not itself a problem — the body is scroll, not clicks. Full CTA-by-section not re-pulled this snapshot.
- Entries: ADHD 4,398 · Productivity 1,335 · Brain-ageing 1,440 (Vercel visits, 31 Jul–10 Aug).

### Timeline additions

`3 Aug PM` end of first weekend at £600/day · `8 Aug (Fri)` **upsell flow added / improved** and **budget rebalanced to £300 ADHD · £200 Brain-ageing · £100 Productivity** (off the earlier even split, weighting toward ADHD as the cheapest-nCPA engine) · `10 Aug` end of second full week (this snapshot).

### Artifact

Dashboard refreshed to 24 Jul – 10 Aug (blended nCPA → £90; spend £8,466 / 94 purchases; per-listicle bars now show Brain-ageing over the £100 line; traffic, CVR, cadence, AOV and reach repulled). Same URL <https://claude.ai/code/artifact/b69a0128-2f0f-4078-a91f-b58d5f8196c4>.

## Snapshot — 2026-08-10 → 2026-08-21 (week 4; efficiency breaks target)

Pulled **21 Aug AM**. Sources: Meta Ads Manager (screenshot from Rudh, all three campaigns), Shopify Admin API (queries 6 + 7, `created_at:>=2026-07-03`), Vercel Web Analytics (visits + section/CTA events). Cumulative framing 24 Jul – 21 Aug.

**Headline: volume is still incremental, but the money stopped working.** Marginal CPA on spend since 10 Aug is **£141.73** against the £100 target, and first-order ROAS on that spend is **0.88×** (was ~1.5× in week 1). The damage sits in the biggest budget: ADHD is buying purchases at **£169**. Brain-ageing — the *smallest* budget — is the only page under target at **£90**.

> **⚠️ Two corrections in this pull.** (1) A **week-bucketing bug** in `weekly-orders.mjs` counted each boundary day in *both* adjacent weeks, inflating every previously published weekly new-demand figure. Fixed (`< end + "T00:00:00Z"`); corrected weeks now reconcile exactly with the order-level pull (tagged sums to 69). The `weeks` array is now generated rolling from `SINCE` so it no longer needs hand-editing. (2) **Brain-ageing is on £100/day, not the £200 recorded on 8 Aug** — Ads Manager shows £100 and its spend since 10 Aug (~£98/day) confirms it. Total daily is **£500, not £600**.

### Meta — cumulative vs marginal (the number that matters)

Cumulative CPA averages four weeks together and lags a change in efficiency by design. **Marginal** = the spend/purchase delta since the 10 Aug pull.

| Listicle | Daily | Spend | Purchases | Cum. CPA | **Marginal CPA** | Meta CVR | £/visitor |
|----------|------:|------:|----------:|---------:|-----------------:|---------:|----------:|
| ADHD | £300 | £6,666.76 | 64 | £104.17 | **£168.50** | 0.66% | £0.69 |
| Productivity | £100 | £3,557.99 | 32 | £111.19 | **£150.00** | 1.02% | £1.13 |
| Brain-ageing | £100 | £3,910.50 | 38 | £102.91 | **£90.04** | 1.38% | £1.42 |
| **All three** | **£500** | **£14,135.25** | **134** | **£105.49** | **£141.73** | 0.86% | £0.91 |

Screenshot carried no visible date range; per-campaign spend deltas since 10 Aug work out at £322 / £95 / £98 a day against stated budgets of £300 / £100 / £100, which fits a cumulative trial-to-date window. Sanity-check on the next pull.

### Why the cost moved (CPA = click price ÷ conversion)

| Page | £/visitor | CVR | CPA | Driver |
|------|-----------|-----|-----|--------|
| ADHD | £0.51 → £0.97 (**+91%**) | 0.70% → 0.58% (−18%) | £73 → £169 | **Click price** (auction / fatigue) |
| Productivity | £1.09 → £1.20 (+9%) | 1.09% → 0.80% (**−27%**) | £100 → £150 | **Conversion** |
| Brain-ageing | £1.42 → £1.31 (−8%) | 1.31% → 1.45% (+11%) | £109 → £90 | Both improved |

- **ADHD is an auction problem.** 512,903 impressions against 177,163 reach ≈ 2.9 frequency, the highest of the three. Clicks nearly doubled in price; conversion softened but is secondary.
- **Productivity is a conversion problem.** Click price barely moved; conversion fell 27%.
- **Brain-ageing is healthy on both axes** and is the only page worth more budget on current numbers.

> **⚠️ Confound — the purchase path was rebuilt mid-trial.** Per `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, **all three PDP heroes went V3 on 11–12 Aug** (plus new plan-picker + subscription box), and **listicle buy zones moved to the V3 PDP hero on 20 Aug**. Neither was recorded as a trial event or run as a conversion test, and both sit inside the window where ADHD (−18%) and Productivity (−27%) lost conversion. Not proven — Brain-ageing's conversion *rose* 11% over the same window on the same path — but rule it out before blaming the auction alone. The 20 Aug change also **resets the baseline**: everything from 21 Aug measures a different page.

### First-party tagged orders — 69 to date (up from 42)

| | Orders | Revenue | AOV | vs 10 Aug |
|--|-------:|--------:|----:|-----------|
| **ADHD** | 41 | £2,408.25 | £58.74 | was 23 |
| **Productivity** | 15 | £1,276.94 | £85.13 | was 13 |
| **Brain-ageing** | 13 | £769.97 | £59.23 | was 6 |
| **Total** | **69** | **£4,455.16** | **£64.57** | was 42 / £2,823.83 |

- **Section split (all 69):** sticky ×35 · hero ×29 · bridge ×5 · **product ×0**. Hero + sticky close 93%; the end-of-page product block has never closed an order.
- **Cadence (all 69):** monthly ×53 (£2,573.29) · quarterly ×13 (£1,678.92) · one-time ×3 (£202.95). Quarterly is 19% of orders and 38% of revenue.
- **Current window (10–21 Aug), 27 orders / £1,631.33:** ADHD 18 (£976.36, 0.49% CVR, £0.27/visitor) · Brain-ageing 7 (£479.98, **0.85%**, **£0.58**) · Productivity 2 (£174.99, 0.23%, £0.20). Productivity has effectively stalled since its budget cut.

### Store-level incrementality (corrected buckets)

| Week | Total | New-demand | Renewals | Tagged | New-demand rev |
|------|------:|-----------:|---------:|-------:|---------------:|
| 3–10 Jul | 20 | 6 | 14 | 0 | £532 |
| 10–17 Jul | 17 | 2 | 15 | 0 | £197 |
| 17–24 Jul | 20 | 4 | 16 | 0 | £274 |
| 24–31 Jul (trial) | 58 | 39 | 19 | 5 | £3,391 |
| 31 Jul–7 Aug | 66 | 50 | 16 | 28 | £3,467 |
| 7–14 Aug | 46 | 32 | 14 | 18 | £2,518 |
| 14–21 Aug | 48 | 34 | 14 | 18 | £2,449 |

- Pre-trial baseline ≈ **4 new-demand orders / £334 a week**. Trial total **155 orders / £11,825**; baseline-equivalent ≈ 16 / £1,336 → **incremental ≈ 139 orders / ≈ £10,489**.
- **Shape:** peak in week 2 (50), then a step down to a **plateau at ~33/week** for two weeks. Not a slide, but a third off peak.
- Renewals flat at 14–19 throughout, so the lift is genuinely new demand.
- **Three lenses (24 Jul – 21 Aug):** tagged **69** (floor) · Meta **134** · store lift **~139**. Ordered as expected and tightly clustered.

### Actions

1. **Move budget out of ADHD into Brain-ageing** — £169 vs £90 marginal CPA. The allocation is upside down.
2. **Confirm the Brain-ageing budget** — running £100/day against £200 recorded. The best page has been at half budget for two weeks.
3. **Refresh ADHD creative** — 2.9 frequency, click price +91%.
4. **Rule out the 11–12 Aug PDP rebuild** — compare funnel entry→purchase either side of 12 Aug before blaming the auction.
5. **Productivity: feed it or cut it** — worst CPA (£150), best AOV (£85), 2 tagged orders in 11 days.
