## ✅ What You Have (And It's Enough)

### Vercel Analytics - Your Detailed Analytics Tool

**What you can see:**
- ✅ All custom events (`quiz:started`, `purchase:add_to_cart`, etc.)
- ✅ **Product-level breakdowns** - Filter by `productId`, `packSize`, `tier`, `source`, etc.
- ✅ Event properties - All the data you're tracking
- ✅ Trends over time
- ✅ Funnel analysis

**How to use it:**
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Analytics → Events
2. Click on any event (e.g., `purchase:add_to_cart`)
3. Use the **breakdown/filter** UI to see:
   - Add-to-carts by product
   - Add-to-carts by source (quiz vs direct)
   - Add-to-carts by pack size
   - Add-to-carts by tier
   - Any property you're tracking

**This is where you get detailed insights.** The UI might be filter-based, but it shows everything you need.
