# Jira Workflow

> **Purpose:** This document defines how to interact with Jira throughout the development lifecycle — creating tickets, writing descriptions and acceptance criteria, updating ticket status, and adding comments. Follow this process to keep Jira in sync with actual work.

---

## When to use this document

- Creating new tickets from a feature request or scoping exercise
- Picking up a ticket to start work
- Updating ticket status as work progresses
- Writing or improving ticket descriptions and acceptance criteria
- Adding implementation notes or blockers to tickets
- Breaking a ticket into subtasks

---

## Board statuses and when to transition

```
To Do → In Progress → In Review → Ready to Deploy → Done
                 ↕
              Blocked
```

| Status | Meaning | When to move here |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| **To Do** | Scoped, ready to be picked up | Ticket is created with full description and AC |
| **In Progress** | Actively being worked on | You start writing code for this ticket |
| **Blocked** | Cannot continue — waiting on something | A dependency, question, or external factor is preventing progress. ALWAYS add a comment explaining what the blocker is |
| **In Review** | Code is complete, needs review | Implementation is finished, code review checklist (doc 06) has been self-completed |
| **Ready to Deploy** | Reviewed and approved, waiting for deployment | Review is passed, no changes needed, just waiting for a deploy cycle |
| **Done** | Deployed and verified | Live in production and confirmed working |

### Transition rules
- **Never skip statuses** — move through them in order (exception: Blocked, which can be entered/exited from In Progress)
- **Always add a comment when moving to Blocked** — state what's blocking and what's needed to unblock
- **Moving to In Review means the work is COMPLETE** — not "mostly done" or "needs a few tweaks"
- **Moving back from In Review to In Progress** — means review found issues that need fixing; add a comment noting what needs to change

## Creating tickets

### When to create tickets
- After scoping work (see `./01-scoping-work.md`) — each task from the scope becomes a ticket
- When a bug is reported or discovered
- When technical debt or improvements are identified during other work

### Issue type selection

| Type | Use when |
|------|----------|
| **Story** | A user-facing feature or behaviour change. Framed as "As a user, I want..." |
| **Task** | Technical work that isn't directly user-facing (refactoring, infrastructure, documentation, setup) |
| **Bug** | Something that's broken — existing functionality not working as expected |
| **Subtask** | A smaller piece of a Story or Task. Use when a ticket needs to be broken into trackable parts |

### Decision logic
```
Is this fixing something broken?
  → YES → Bug

Is this a user-facing change?
  → YES → Story

Is this technical/internal work?
  → YES → Task

Is this a smaller piece of an existing ticket?
  → YES → Subtask (under the parent ticket)
```

## Writing ticket descriptions

Every ticket MUST have a description. The format varies by type:

### Story description template

```markdown
## Summary
[One sentence: what the user should be able to do after this is complete]

## Context
[Why this is needed — the user problem or business goal. Keep to 2-3 sentences max]

## Requirements
- [Specific requirement 1]
- [Specific requirement 2]
- [Specific requirement 3]

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] [Given/When/Then or clear testable statement]
- [ ] [Given/When/Then or clear testable statement]
- [ ] [Given/When/Then or clear testable statement]

## Design / UI notes
[Reference to designs, style guide, or describe expected UI behaviour]
[Link to figma/mockup if available]

## Technical notes (if known)
[Any known technical considerations, affected areas, or dependencies]

## Out of scope
[Explicitly list anything that might be assumed but is NOT part of this ticket]
```

### Task description template

```markdown
## Summary
[What needs to be done and why]

## Details
[Specific technical details of the work required]

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] [Testable completion criteria]
- [ ] [Testable completion criteria]

## References
[Links to relevant docs, PRs, or related tickets]
```

### Bug description template

```markdown
## Bug summary
[One sentence: what's broken]

## Steps to reproduce
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

## Expected behaviour
[What should happen]

## Actual behaviour
[What actually happens]

## Environment
- Platform: [iOS / Android / Both]
- App version: [if known]
- Reproducibility: [Always / Sometimes / Rare]

## Screenshots / logs
[Attach or describe any error messages, screenshots, or relevant logs]

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] [The specific bug is fixed]
- [ ] [No regression in related functionality]
```

---

## Writing good acceptance criteria

Acceptance criteria are the most important part of a ticket. They define "done."

### Rules
1. **Every criterion must be independently testable** — you can verify it with a yes/no
2. **Be specific, not vague** — "works correctly" is not an AC; "returns 200 with user object containing name and email" is
3. **Include edge cases** — empty states, error states, boundary conditions
4. **Include both frontend and backend criteria** when the ticket spans both

### Good vs bad examples

| Bad | Good |
|-----|------|
| User can log in | Given valid credentials, when the user taps Login, then they are navigated to the Home screen within 3 seconds |
| API works | POST /api/v1/items returns 201 with the created item, including a generated ID and created_at timestamp |
| Handles errors | When the API returns 500, the screen shows the error banner with a "Try again" button that retries the request |
| Looks good on mobile | Component matches the design spec, text truncates with ellipsis at 2 lines, and touch target is minimum 44x44pt |

### Minimum AC per ticket type
- **Story:** At least 3 ACs covering happy path, one error case, and one edge case
- **Task:** At least 2 ACs covering the deliverable and any verification
- **Bug:** At least 2 ACs — the fix itself, and no regression

---

## Updating tickets during work

### When starting work (To Do → In Progress)
1. Transition the ticket to **In Progress**
2. Read the full description and AC
3. IF the description or AC is unclear or incomplete → improve it before coding, or ask for clarification

### During implementation
Add comments to the ticket for:
- **Decisions made** that aren't captured in the description ("Decided to use Firestore instead of Cloud SQL for this because...")
- **Scope discoveries** ("Found that this also requires updating the notification service")
- **Partial progress on long tasks** ("Backend endpoints complete, starting frontend")

### When blocked (In Progress → Blocked)
1. Transition to **Blocked**
2. **MUST add a comment** explaining:
   - What is blocking progress
   - What is needed to unblock (a decision, another ticket, external dependency)
   - Any workaround being considered

Comment format:
```
**Blocked:** [What's blocking]
**Needs:** [What would unblock this]
**Workaround:** [If any, or "None"]
```

### When submitting for review (In Progress → In Review)
1. Complete the self-review checklist from `./06-code-review.md`
2. Transition to **In Review**
3. Add a comment summarising what was done:

Comment format:
```
**Implementation summary:**
- [Key thing built/changed 1]
- [Key thing built/changed 2]

**Files changed:** [list key files or areas]

**Testing done:**
- [What was tested and how]

**Notes for reviewer:**
- [Anything the reviewer should know — gotchas, decisions, trade-offs]
```

### When review passes (In Review → Ready to Deploy or Done)
- IF there's a separate deploy step → move to **Ready to Deploy**
- IF it can go straight to production → move to **Done**
- Add a brief comment confirming completion if there's anything noteworthy

### When review finds issues (In Review → In Progress)
1. Move back to **In Progress**
2. Add a comment noting what needs to change
3. When fixes are done, move back to **In Review** with a comment on what was addressed

---

## Breaking tickets into subtasks

### When to create subtasks
- The parent ticket involves 3+ distinct pieces of work
- Different parts could be reviewed independently
- You want to track progress on a large ticket more granularly

### Subtask conventions
- Subtask titles should be prefixed with the area: `[Backend] Create user endpoint`, `[Frontend] Build profile screen`
- Each subtask needs its own AC (not just "part of parent")
- Parent ticket should only move to In Review when ALL subtasks are complete
- Subtask descriptions can be shorter but must still have clear AC

### Subtask ordering
Follow the same ordering from `./01-scoping-work.md`:
1. Database / schema changes
2. Backend API endpoints
3. Shared frontend components
4. Screen-level frontend work
5. Integration and testing

---

## Linking tickets

Link related tickets when:
- One ticket **blocks** another → use "Blocks" link type
- Tickets are **related** but independent → use "Relates to" link type
- A ticket **duplicates** another → use "Duplicates" link type
- A bug was **caused by** a story/task → use "Caused by" or "Relates to"

---

## Quick reference: common actions

| I want to... | Do this |
|---------------|---------|
| Start working on a ticket | Read description → transition to In Progress |
| Record a blocker | Transition to Blocked → add comment with blocker details |
| Finish implementation | Self-review (doc 06) → transition to In Review → add summary comment |
| Create tickets from a scope | Use scoping doc (01) output → create one ticket per task with full description and AC |
| Break a big ticket down | Create subtasks under parent → each with own AC → work through in order |
| Note a decision during work | Add comment to ticket explaining what was decided and why |
| Flag something for follow-up | Add comment with "FOLLOW-UP:" prefix, or create a new linked ticket |
