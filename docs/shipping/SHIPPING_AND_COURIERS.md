# Shipping & Courier Services

**Status:** Working draft. Lives alongside the Synergy 3PL plan
(`docs/development/featurePlans/archive/synergy-3pl-integration.md`) during active config;
to be formalised into a standalone feature doc once the Shopify shipping setup is
live and verified.
**Owner:** Rudh (Shopify config) with Humphrey (carrier/ops decisions).

## 1. The model — how Shopify shipping maps to Synergy

Checkout is Shopify-hosted; Synergy fulfils the 3 funnel products. The link between
them is the **shipping method name**.

**Every Shopify shipping rate does two jobs at once:**
- its **name** is the instruction to Synergy — *which carrier/service to ship with*;
- its **price** is what the customer pays.

**Synergy maps purely on the shipping-method NAME.** Not the destination country, not
the price. Country + weight are used only to calculate how Synergy *invoices us*, never
to decide the carrier.

Two rules fall out of this:
1. **A unique carrier/service needs a unique method name.** If two options share a
   name, Synergy can't tell them apart.
2. **Price can vary freely under one name.** The same name (e.g. `Express International`)
   can cost £12 to Europe and £40 to Rest of World — Synergy ignores the price, so one
   name still means one carrier.

---

## 2. Carrier choice at checkout

To offer the customer a choice of carrier/speed, put **two (or more) rates in the same
zone**. Shopify shows every eligible rate at checkout; the customer picks one; the
cheapest is the effective default.

- Each option **must have a unique name** (rule 1 above) so Synergy routes each correctly.
- Customers choose on **speed or price**, so frame the choice that way
  (e.g. "Standard" vs "Express") rather than as two same-speed carriers.

Examples:
- **UK:** `Express` (Evri, free) + `24 Hour Delivery` (DPD, paid) → customer picks.
- **International:** `Express International` (Evri) + `International Priority` (DHL, dearer)
  → customer picks. *(DHL option is a fast-follow — see §4.)*

## 3. UK shipping — weight-banded (SCRUM-1079, live 2026-06-11)

Both UK rates are **weight-banded** so freight scales with order size. The flat rates
(Express free, 24 Hour Delivery flat £6.54) were priced for a 1–3 box order and leaked
badly on bulk; the leak is order-size-driven, not channel-driven (a DTC 8-box order
leaks like a 50-box club). Plan + rationale: `docs/development/featurePlans/order-size-shipping-tiers.md`.

**How to read these tables.** 1 box = 28 shots = **2.1 kg = 2,100 g**. Up to 3 boxes case
into **1 outer carton** that ships as a single parcel, so **cartons shipped = ceil(boxes ÷ 3)**.
Carrier cost ≈ cartons × carriage rate (Evri £2.92/parcel, DPD £6.54/parcel; §3 cards below).
Each band is entered in Shopify as a **Weight** rate-type tier (in grams). Shopify treats a
tier's **maximum as exclusive** (a cart exactly on a boundary falls into the higher band), so
every maximum is set **+1,050 g (half a box) above the true boundary** — this keeps exact
box-counts (6/12/24/50) inside the intended band and tolerates a small mixed-cart add-on
without losing the band. Rate **names are unchanged** (`Express`, `24 Hour Delivery`) because
Synergy maps on name only.

### `Express` (Evri) — UK standard

| Weight band (g) | Weight band (kg) | Price | Boxes | Cartons shipped | Our Evri cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 – 13,650 | 0 – 13.65 | **Free** | 1 to 6 | 1 to 2 | £2.92 – £5.84 |
| 13,650 – 26,250 | 13.65 – 26.25 | **£12** | 7 to 12 | 3 to 4 | £8.76 – £11.68 |
| 26,250 – 51,450 | 26.25 – 51.45 | **£25** | 13 to 24 | 5 to 8 | £14.60 – £23.36 |
| 51,450 – 106,050 | 51.45 – 106.05 | **£50** | 25 to 50 | 9 to 17 | £26.28 – £49.64 |
| 106,050 – No limit | 106.05+ | **£75** | 51+ | 17+ | £49.64+ |

### `24 Hour Delivery` (DPD) — UK next-day

| Weight band (g) | Weight band (kg) | Price | Boxes | Cartons shipped | Our DPD cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 – 13,650 | 0 – 13.65 | **£6.54** | 1 to 6 | 1 to 2 | £6.54 – £13.08 |
| 13,650 – 26,250 | 13.65 – 26.25 | **£26** | 7 to 12 | 3 to 4 | £19.62 – £26.16 |
| 26,250 – 51,450 | 26.25 – 51.45 | **£52** | 13 to 24 | 5 to 8 | £32.70 – £52.32 |
| 51,450 – No limit | 51.45+ | **£110** | 25+ | 9+ | £58.86+ |

Notes:
- **Free band covers up to the quarterly bundle** (`BOTH-FUNNEL-168` = 6 boxes = 12,600 g),
  so no subscriber or normal order ever pays. The 6-box top of the free band costs us up to
  £5.84 (2 cartons) — eaten deliberately to protect the free-shipping promise.
- **24 Hour Delivery loses a little on 4–6 box orders** (2 cartons = £13.08 DPD, charged
  £6.54): intentional, to keep the common 1–3 box next-day price unchanged at break-even.
- **Both top bands under-recover past ~75 boxes (Express) / the largest next-day orders** by
  design — those belong on the B2B invoice path or a manual pallet line (a pallet only beats
  parcels above ~60 boxes).

**Carrier carriage cards (cost to us, from the Synergy cards):**

*Evri UK ("safe place" / POD):* 48hr 0–3kg (1 box) £2.25/£2.38 · 48hr 3–15kg (2–6 boxes)
£2.92/£3.05 · 24hr 0–15kg £3.48/£3.61 · 48hr Large parcel 15kg+ £8.73/£8.86 · Northern
Ireland 0–15kg £3.17/£3.30 · Scottish H&I / IoM / IoW £4.37/£4.50 · Channel Islands £5.17/£5.30.

*DPD UK:* Two Day Mainland £5.34 · **Next Day Mainland £6.54** · Before 12 £11.11 · Before
10:30 £15.87 · Saturday £11.11 · Sunday £11.11.

**DECIDED (2026-06-10): `24 Hour Delivery` = DPD Next Day** (Evri's own 24hr at £3.48 was
cheaper but DPD chosen for the more premium next-day service). The flat £6.54 became the
1–6 box base band on 2026-06-11.

## 4. International shipping — weight-banded (in progress, June 2026)

International is being moved to the **same weight-banded `Weight` rate-type model as UK**,
because the old flat rates (priced for a 1-box order) bled badly on quarterly orders in
long-haul zones (a 168 to New Zealand cost ~£200, charged £38). Every rate stays named
**`Express International`** (Evri, one carrier — Synergy maps on name only).

**Decisions (June 2026):**
- **All international = Evri.** (DHL `International Priority` upgrade remains a future
  fast-follow, not built.)
> ⚠️ **SUPERSEDED (2026-09-07) — the DAP decision below is being reversed.** The EU
> abolished the €150 duty exemption on 1 Jul 2026 and France added a national parcel tax
> on 1 Mar 2026, so DAP now lands French customers a punitive doorstep bill. The US $800
> de minimis is also gone, which invalidates the flat £22 US rate. Plan of record:
> `docs/development/featurePlans/international-duties-and-ddp.md`. Do not re-derive the
> incoterm model from this section until that plan is folded back in here.

- **Incoterm = DAP / Evri DDU service: the customer pays import duty/VAT on arrival.** So
  costs below are the Evri **duty-unpaid (DDU) / commercial** rates (the customer-pays-duty
  service), which is the true cost under DAP. EU customers get a duty bill on delivery —
  a deliberate, accepted trade-off.
- **Priced near worst-country cost per zone**, per box, to never under-recover.
- **No rate above 6 boxes / 13,650 g** in any international zone — Evri's international
  parcel maxes at 15 kg / 6 boxes, so genuine bulk has no self-checkout rate and routes to
  enquiry (customer-arranged freight forwarder).

**Tier boundaries (identical to UK — grams, max-exclusive, +1,050 g half-box buffer):**
1 box ≤3,150 · 2 box ≤5,250 · 3 box ≤7,350 · 4–6 box ≤13,650 · above that **no rate**.

**Per-zone band prices (customer charge, GBP):**

| Zone (Shopify) | Covers | 1 box | 2 box | 3 box (84) | 4–6 box (168) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Europe (single zone) | Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Ireland, Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, Finland (11) | £20 | £23 | £26 | £41 | **LIVE + verified** (priced at the "Mid" band, see note) |
| france | France | £20 | £22 | £24 | £32 | **LIVE + verified** |
| Middle East | UAE | £13 | £17 | £20 | £36 | **LIVE + verified** |
| Canada | Canada | £36 | £52 | £68 | £134 | **LIVE + verified** |
| Australia | Australia | £25 | £40 | £56 | £116 | **LIVE + verified** |
| New Zealand | New Zealand | £38 | £65 | £91 | £203 | **LIVE + verified** |
| Africa | South Africa | £42 | £60 | £77 | £151 | **LIVE + verified** |
| Caribbean | Bahamas, Cayman Islands | £57 | £78 | £99 | £188 | **LIVE + verified** |

**Europe — single zone at "Mid" band (decision 11 Jun 2026).** The 11-country zone has a
~4× DDU cost spread (Ireland 168 ≈ £15, Italy 168 ≈ £63). Rather than split it now, it is
priced at the middle band (£20/£23/£26/£41) as a pragmatic compromise:
- **Cheap countries (Ireland, Netherlands, Germany)** are slightly over-charged (a 168 costs
  ~£15–26 but is charged £41) — a conversion drag, accepted for now.
- **Expensive countries (Italy, Spain, Portugal, Denmark, Finland)** still under-recover at
  quarterly (Italy 168 costs ~£63, charged £41 = ~−£22) — but far better than the old £14.40
  flat (which lost ~£48 on the same order).
- **Future refinement:** split into Near / Mid / Far (£14/16/18/26 · £20/23/26/41 ·
  £29/34/40/63) to fix both ends. Tables retained for when that is wanted.

**Not banded / left as-is:**
- **USA** — flat £22 interim; the real US rate is a separate USD / scaled / DDP build (DHL),
  unstarted.
- **Channel Islands (Jersey)** — flat £4.99; no Evri rate-card data, UK-adjacent, low cost.
  Revisit if a cost emerges.
- **Not shipped** (no zone): Cyprus, Greece, Malta, and anywhere unlisted.

**Source:** band prices derived from the Evri international rate card
(`evri-bands-extract.csv`), worst country per zone at the DDU/commercial service, rounded
up to cover cost.

**Verification gotcha:** all band prices are configured in **GBP**, but the Storefront API
(and checkout) returns shipping in the customer's **local presentment currency** where one
is enabled (AUD, CAD, USD/BSD). So a Storefront cart probe shows e.g. AUD 49 for the £25
Australia tier — divide by the FX rate to compare. Zones with no enabled presentment
currency (e.g. South Africa/ZAR) fall back to GBP and read 1:1.

## 5. Target Shopify rate table (launch state)

**UK zone (done):**
| Rate name | Carrier | Price |
|---|---|---|
| `Express` | Evri | Free |
| `24 Hour Delivery` | DPD | £6.54 |

**International zones:** keep the existing ~10 zones, all rates named `Express International`
(Evri), prices per the §4 table. *(Fast-follow: add `International Priority` (DHL) as a
second rate per intl zone for the upgrade option.)*

**Steps in Shopify (Settings → Shipping):**
1. Names: every international rate = `Express International` exactly (rename the Channel
   Islands one). UK = `Express` + `24 Hour Delivery`. This is what drives Synergy routing.
2. Prices: apply the §4 changes — raise Africa (£42), Australia (£28), NZ (£38); split
   Canada into its own zone (£36, USA stays £22); leave the rest.

**Test-order readiness:** the 3 Synergy test orders only use `Express`,
`24 Hour Delivery`, `Express International` — all already exist, so testing is not blocked
by the price/zone work.

---

## 6. Synergy mapping sheet

Synergy maps each method name to a carrier + service. Current sheet (3 rows — covers all
test orders):

```
Shipping Method           | Carrier | Service       | Market | INCOTERMS
Express                   | Evri    | Standard      | UK     | n/a
24 Hour Delivery          | DPD     | Next Day      | UK     | n/a
Express International     | Evri    | International | ROW    | DAP
Express International DHL | DHL     | International | ROW    | DAP
```

**`Express International DHL` is live** (DHL **Air** service, set up 5 Aug 2026, confirmed by
Mihaela Lapadus). It sits alongside the Evri method as the premium international option, not
as a replacement. It was added after Evri failed to produce a label for a France order
(`13234918031734`), which went back to stock through returns.

Synergy's portal has no view of the agreed method list; this table is the record. Terms of
Sale are a per-method menu choice (DAP or DDP) that Synergy can change on request.

⚠️ The `DAP` terms of sale are the direct cause of the Sept 2026 France surprise-charge
problem. Plan of record is to flip **`Express International DHL` to `DDP`** and route EU (and
later US) traffic to it, leaving the Evri row on DAP. Because DHL is already a separate
method, this needs no new rate name. See
`docs/development/featurePlans/international-duties-and-ddp.md`.

**Test observation (2026-06-17):** all 3 Synergy test orders shipped back via **Evri
(EVRICORP tracking)**, including the `24 Hour Delivery` order that is mapped to DPD —
because Synergy's carrier accounts were not yet live. Confirmation requested from Bethany
that `24 Hour Delivery` will route to DPD once the carrier accounts are set up. Routing on
method name is otherwise validated end-to-end (writeback populated carrier + tracking).

Added later as features land:
- `International Priority` | DHL | Express | ROW | DAP  — the DHL upgrade.
- `Pallet` (or similar) | [pallet carrier] | [service] | [market] | [incoterm]  — bulk/B2B (see §7).

---

## 7. Large / bulk orders & pallets

**Packing model (confirmed with Synergy):**
- **Retail orders (any funnel SKU, up to 168 = 6 boxes)** ship as **one wrapped parcel,
  one label, at the combined weight** (28=2.1kg, 56=4.2kg, 84=6.3kg, 168=12.6kg). 12.6kg
  is within Evri's parcel limit, so even the biggest retail order is a single parcel — the
  combined-weight Evri rate applies (this is why a 168 to a far zone is genuinely
  expensive; see §4).
- **B2B bulk orders cannot be consolidated into one parcel.** Boxes are cased in a
  **master carton of 3 Conka boxes = 6.3kg**. A large order is therefore either put **on a
  pallet**, or shipped as **multiple parcels — one label per master carton** (each 6.3kg).

| Tier | Size | How it ships |
|---|---|---|
| Retail parcel | 1–6 boxes (≤12.6kg) | single wrapped parcel, one label, combined weight |
| B2B multi-parcel | below the pallet line | N parcels, one label per master carton (3 boxes / 6.3kg) |
| **Pallet / freight** | **~60+ boxes (cost crossover)** | EFM pallet network (UK) — see economics below |

### Pallet economics (EFM rate card, supplied by Synergy 2026-06-10)

EFM is Synergy's UK domestic pallet carrier (1-2 day). Rate is **per pallet, by UK postcode
zone, regardless of how full it is**: cheapest **£60.82** (zone 1, near their Northampton
warehouse), most mainland **£61-90**, Scottish Highlands/islands **£88-175**.
(`docs/shipping/EFMRateCard.xlsx.csv`.)

Compare to shipping the same order as **master-carton parcels** (3 boxes / 6.3kg each, the
3-15kg Evri band = **£2.92/carton**):

| Order | Cartons | Parcel cost @ £2.92 | UK mainland pallet | Cheaper |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 10 boxes | 4 | ~£12 | £61-90 | **parcels (5×)** |
| 30 boxes | 10 | ~£29 | £61-90 | **parcels** |
| 50 boxes | 17 | ~£50 | £61-90 | **parcels** |
| 60 boxes | 20 | ~£58 | £61-90 | ~level |
| 75 boxes | 25 | ~£73 | £61-90 | pallet |

**Conclusion: a pallet doesn't pay until ~60+ boxes (UK mainland).** These boxes are light
enough that parcels win on cost almost always. The earlier 10-box threshold was far too low
(at 10 boxes a pallet ships ~£12 of parcels for £60). **Revised line: ~60 boxes, or a
judgement call** (too many parcels to handle, damage risk, customer wants one delivery).

**International bulk:** EFM is **UK-only**, so there is **no international pallet rate yet**.
International *parcel* cost per carton is steep and varies hugely (Europe ~£11, USA £32,
Australia £56, Canada £67, NZ £91 — the 6.5kg band of the Evri intl sheet), so a 10-box US
order is ~£115 in parcels. Because intl parcels are so dear, an intl pallet could pay off at
a *lower* box count than the UK — but we lack the freight rate. **Action: ask Synergy if they
do international freight + rates; until then quote international bulk case-by-case.**

**How Synergy handles the multiple labels:** their warehouse packs the order into N cartons
and generates N labels itself, all under the **one shipping method name** on the order. We
set a single method; they decide the parcel count. Consequence: we charge the customer **one**
shipping fee but Synergy bills us **per parcel**, so a multi-carton order costs more than the
fee collected (absorb on B2B, or add a cost on the big ones).

Pallets are therefore **rare** — only genuine bulk B2B (~60+ boxes UK). Mechanism: a
uniquely-named `Pallet` method → mapped to EFM on the Synergy sheet, used only when needed.

**The B2B wrinkle — RESOLVED (2026-06-11, SCRUM-1079 Phase 2).** The invoice route
(`app/api/b2b/invoice-order/route.ts`) now attaches a `shippingLine` to every draft
order: title `Express` (so Synergy can route it once B2B moves there in Phase 3),
priced from the combined box count using the §3 UK Express bands (Free to 6 boxes,
£12 / £25 / £50, £75 catch-all at 51+). Pallets stay manual, per the playbook below.

### Manual pallet playbook (UK, ~60+ boxes — interim, no automation)

Invoice orders auto-arrive with the `Express` £75 catch-all line. When a pallet is
the better call (~60+ boxes, or judgement: parcel count unwieldy, damage risk,
customer wants one delivery):

1. **Edit the draft order** in Shopify Admin: replace the shipping line with a
   custom rate titled `Pallet`, priced from the EFM card by postcode zone
   (mainland £61–90, Scottish Highlands/islands £88–175 — `EFMRateCard.xlsx.csv`).
2. **Resend the invoice** (draft order → Send invoice) so the finance team sees the
   updated total before paying. The hosted invoice URL always shows the current
   draft state, so an early-paid stale total can't happen after a resend.
3. **First pallet only:** make sure `Pallet` is added to the Synergy mapping sheet
   (→ EFM) and give the Client Manager a heads-up. (Until Phase 3, B2B fulfils from
   Burnside, so steps here are Shopify-only.)

**International pallet:** none via Synergy yet. The customer arranges their own
freight forwarder (Europa, Kuehne+Nagel) to collect; notify the Synergy Client
Manager of the collection date. Quote case-by-case.

**International invoice orders (rare, manual):** the route has no address when the
draft is created (the buyer enters it on the hosted invoice), so it always prices
freight on the UK Express bands. The custom line is fixed - Shopify does not
recalculate it when the address comes in. If a non-UK club orders by invoice, edit
the draft: retitle the line `Express International` (≤6 boxes, §4 zone price) or
quote freight case-by-case for bulk, then resend the invoice. VAT also needs a
manual look on these (the portal assumes UK 20%).

**Open questions — RESOLVED (Bethany, 2026-06-10):**

For **Synergy / Bethany**:
1. Carton/parcel logic — **CONFIRMED.** 3 × 28-shot boxes per master carton (~6.3kg) → one
   label in the 3-15kg Evri band (~£3), bulk ships cheapest as multiple cartons until ~60 boxes.
2. Per-parcel pick/handling fee — **none from Synergy** beyond standard inbound/picking/contracted
   charges. Carrier surcharges (refused parcel, address change, Middle East fuel, peak) pass
   through **at cost** and can't be pre-quoted.
3. International freight/pallet — **no Synergy international pallet yet.** Customers arrange their
   own freight forwarder (Europa, Kuehne+Nagel) to collect; notify the Client Manager the
   collection date. Khalil is building a solution, nothing live.

For **CONKA / Harry**:
4. Fulfilment of B2B / large orders — **decision: Synergy** (B2B is the same physical box as the
   funnel SKUs, so consolidate B2B onto the funnel SKUs rather than re-onboard). Tracked as Phase 3
   of `order-size-shipping-tiers.md`.
5. What B2B pays for shipping — **resolved via weight-banded tiers**, not a B2B carve-out (the
   mispricing is order-size-driven; a DTC 8-box buyer leaks the same as a 50-box club). See the
   plan + first-pass band table in `docs/development/featurePlans/order-size-shipping-tiers.md`.

**Plan of record (SCOPED 2026-06-10 → `order-size-shipping-tiers.md`):** weight-band the global
Shopify rates so freight scales with order size for everyone (free to 6 boxes / 12.6kg, then
banded), add a shipping line to the B2B invoice draft order in code, keep parcels-by-default with
the pallet only ~60+ boxes UK (manual draft-order line), and consolidate B2B onto the funnel SKUs
so it fulfils from Synergy. International bulk quoted case-by-case until freight rates exist.

## 8. Cost reference data

- **Evri international rates 2026:** `docs/shipping/EvriInternationalRates2026.xlsx.csv`
  (full sheet, 225 destinations, weights in 0.25kg steps to 2kg then 0.5kg).
- **Extracted bands** (cost at 1/2/3/6 box billed weights, all destinations):
  `docs/shipping/evri-bands-extract.csv`.
- **Evri UK + DPD UK carriage cards:** in §3 (from Synergy's UK carriage-fee screenshots).
- **DHL international:** not yet supplied (needed for the `International Priority` upgrade).

**Billed-weight bands** (real box weight rounds up to the next rate column):

| Order | Real weight | Billed band |
|---|---|---|
| 1 box (28) | 2.1 kg | 2.50 kg |
| 2 box (Both 56) | 4.2 kg | 4.50 kg |
| 3 box (84) | 6.3 kg | 6.50 kg |
| 6 box (Both 168) | 12.6 kg | 15.00 kg |

## 9. Open decisions / TODO

- [x] **Next-day UK carrier:** DECIDED — DPD Next Day at £6.54. §3.
- [x] **UK zone:** Express (free) + 24 Hour Delivery (£6.54) — done.
- [ ] **Apply international price changes in place:** Africa £42, Australia £28, NZ £38,
      split Canada (£36) from USA (£22); rename Channel Islands rate → `Express International`. §4/§5.
- [ ] **DHL upgrade:** obtain DHL intl costs, finalise `International Priority` name + per-zone
      prices, decide launch timing. §4.
- [x] **Pallet tier / B2B shipping:** ops answers received (Bethany 10 Jun); scoped into
      `docs/development/featurePlans/order-size-shipping-tiers.md` (weight-banded global rates +
      B2B invoice shipping line + Synergy consolidation). §7.
- [ ] **EU DDP split** (optimisation): split Europe into its own duty-paid method. §4.
- [ ] **Bundle variant weights** in Shopify (84=6.3kg, 56=4.2kg, 168=12.6kg) — needed if/when
      any rate is weight-banded. (28-box already 2.1kg.)
