# Loox product IDs and Shopify lookup

The Loox CSV uses Shopify **product IDs** (numeric). To see which product each ID is, use the list below and the Shopify Admin API.

## Are these all our products? Do we have Conka Clear?

- **productIdCounts** lists every product ID that appears in the current CSV (7 IDs = 7 distinct products in this export). We can’t tell from the ID alone which is Flow vs Clear; that’s what the Shopify lookup is for.
- **productTypeCounts** (in `docs/loox-product-ids.json`) is derived from the *handle* field (e.g. `conka-flow-*` → flow, `*clear*` → clarity, `protocol-*` → protocol). If `productTypeCounts.clarity` is 0, this export has **no Conka Clear reviews** – only Flow and/or Protocol product handles. Run `npm run build:reviews` and check the JSON to see flow/clarity/protocol breakdown.

## Product ID counts (from Loox CSV)

| productId       | review count | Map in Shopify to |
|-----------------|-------------|--------------------|
| 15406133936502  | 590         | _fill after lookup_ |
| 9540507828509   | 3           | _fill after lookup_ |
| 15530286678390  | 2           | _fill after lookup_ |
| 15528620589430  | 1           | _fill after lookup_ |
| 15007602278774  | 1           | _fill after lookup_ |
| 15476122091894  | 1           | _fill after lookup_ |
| 8566607642909   | 1           | _fill after lookup_ |

Raw data is in `docs/loox-product-ids.json` (generated by `npm run build:reviews`). It includes `productIdCounts`, `productTypeCounts` (flow / clarity / protocol by handle), and `generated` timestamp.

## Postman: get product title by ID

Shopify Admin API uses **GraphQL** (recommended) or REST. You need an **Admin API access token** (Custom app or private app in Shopify Admin: Settings → Apps and sales channels → Develop apps → Create an app → Configure Admin API scopes → Install app → reveal token).

### GraphQL (recommended)

**URL:** `POST https://YOUR_STORE.myshopify.com/admin/api/2024-01/graphql.json`

**Headers:**

| Key                 | Value |
|---------------------|--------|
| `Content-Type`      | `application/json` |
| `X-Shopify-Access-Token` | `YOUR_ADMIN_ACCESS_TOKEN` |

**Body (raw JSON):**

```json
{
  "query": "query getProduct($id: ID!) { product(id: $id) { id title handle } }",
  "variables": {
    "id": "gid://shopify/Product/15406133936502"
  }
}
```

- Replace `15406133936502` with the numeric product ID from the table.
- Shopify product IDs in GraphQL are **GIDs**: `gid://shopify/Product/{numeric_id}`.

**Example for one product:**

```json
{
  "query": "query { product(id: \"gid://shopify/Product/15406133936502\") { id title handle } }"
}
```

### REST (legacy)

**URL:** `GET https://YOUR_STORE.myshopify.com/admin/api/2024-01/products/15406133936502.json`

**Headers:**

| Key                 | Value |
|---------------------|--------|
| `X-Shopify-Access-Token` | `YOUR_ADMIN_ACCESS_TOKEN` |

Replace `15406133936502` with the numeric product ID.

After you identify each ID, you can note it in the table above or in `app/lib/testimonialsFromLoox.ts` (e.g. a comment or a small mapping object) if you want to show product names from Shopify instead of our derived `productType` (flow / clarity / protocol).
