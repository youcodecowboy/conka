# PDP carousel slides

**The general technique is documented in
[`docs/development/IMAGE_ASSET_PIPELINE.md`](../../docs/development/IMAGE_ASSET_PIPELINE.md).**
This file covers only what is specific to this set.

Source for the Flow PDP carousel assets. **Not shipped** — nothing under `app/`
imports this directory; it is design source that renders *into* `public/`.

## Source photography is not in the repo

`assets/` is a **gitignored symlink**. The 13 source images are 5.3MB that never
serve, and they are derived from the Ai Assets library, so they live at:

```
~/.claude/projects/-Users-rudh-Conka-Repos-conkaWebsite/pdp-slide-assets/
```

The slide HTML *is* in the repo, deliberately. Those files carry fourteen live
prices and several claims, so `git grep 39.99` finds every carousel image a price
change invalidates. Nothing else in the repo makes that link.

On a fresh clone, recreate the symlink before rendering:

```bash
ln -s ~/.claude/projects/-Users-rudh-Conka-Repos-conkaWebsite/pdp-slide-assets \
      design/pdp-slides/assets
```

`render.sh` fails with that instruction if the link is missing, rather than
rendering slides with silently broken images.

## Render

```bash
./render.sh          # all slides
./render.sh s1 s4    # just those
```

Output goes to `public/formulas/mmPdpAssetsV2/`. The consumer is
`MM_GALLERY_ASSETS["01"]` in `app/lib/mmPdpData.ts`, plus `starterPackImage`
on Flow `monthly-sub` in `app/lib/offerData.ts` (slide `s0`).

Two slides are product-agnostic and are shared by both galleries, hence the
`Shared` prefix: proof and testing. The guarantee is not shared — each formula
shows its own box, since the caps differ.

`s1` / `c1` use the hand-hold photographs, which are the only human presence in
the set and the only thing that conveys how small a 30ml shot actually is.
Clear's pricing is numerically identical to Flow's at every cadence, so `c0`
and `c0q` carry the same figures as `s0` / `s0q` and differ only in photograph.

`s0` and `s0q` share one plain photo and differ only in their figures — the
same arrangement the Figma frames use, where monthly and quarterly point at a
single image hash with different labels composited on top.

Flow's pack shot is `FlowStartPackV2.jpg`, cropped from a 2000x2000 square to
the 2400x1380 band around the products (rows 470-1620 of the source). Cropping
rather than letterboxing means it fills the frame width, so there are no side
gaps to colour-match, and the cast shadow stays intact instead of being cut.

## Constraints that shaped these

- **Authored at 2400×1715 (7:5)**, the aspect `ProductImageSlideshow` renders.
  Downsampled to 2000px on render — the carousel tops out near 1400px even at
  3× DPR, so 2000 is headroom, not waste.
- **Type floor: ~90px in the artboard.** Slides render full-bleed at 100vw on
  mobile, so a 390px phone scales the artboard by 6.15×. Anything under ~90px
  lands below 14px and stops being readable. This is why the old comparison
  slide failed: its row labels rendered at an effective 7.6px.
- **No grain overlay.** An earlier version had one; it doubled JPEG weight
  (730K → 372K without) and is invisible below ~1000px.
- **Fonts are the real brand faces** — Neue Haas Grotesk, ABC Favorit and
  JetBrains Mono, loaded from `app/fonts/` via `@font-face`. Figma's MCP cannot
  set Neue Haas at all, which is why these are authored here rather than there.

## Gotchas

- `render.sh` passes `--virtual-time-budget=8000`. Without it Chrome can
  screenshot before the local `@font-face` files load and text renders **blank**
  with no error.
- macOS ships bash 3.2, so `render.sh` uses a `case` statement rather than an
  associative array.
- `FlowCutout.png` was cut from `Product Ai Assets/New Shot Lables/Nomio
  Style/FlowSingle.png` by thresholding on saturation and luminance, then
  filling each row between its first and last hit. A flood fill from the border
  does **not** work — it leaks through the translucent amber glass.

## Prices are burned into `s0` / `s0q`

The bottom bars carry £152.94 / £39.99 and £328.90 / £109.99. This
contradicts the rule in
`docs/development/featurePlans/flow-starter-pack.md` that prices live in HTML,
though the artwork it replaced broke it too. If any figure changes, edit the
relevant slide and re-run `render.sh`.

## Clear's pack photo is a generation behind

Flow uses `FlowStartPackV2.jpg`; Clear is still on `ClearStartPackClean.jpg`,
which is the older treatment. A Clear shot matching the Flow V2 setup would fix
both the label fault below and the treatment mismatch in one go.

## Known fault in the Clear pack photo

`assets/ClearStartPackClean.jpg` shows bottles with **white Clear caps but
"Flow" labels**. Verified at 3x zoom. The artwork it replaces
(`public/formulas/starterPack/ClearStarterPack.jpg`) has the identical fault, so
this is inherited rather than introduced — but it is wrong and the source render
should be regenerated with Clear labels.

## Clear bottle resolution

`ClearCutout.png` is 310x624 of actual bottle against Flow's 435x874, so Clear
runs about 29% softer at matched scale. Aspect matches to 0.001, so layouts
transfer between the two without adjustment. An earlier candidate from
`FMC-style/ClearTransparent.png` was the same resolution but carried a visible
olive-green cast; the current file is the correct warm amber.

## Both

`BothCutout.png` is composited from `FlowCutout` and `ClearCutout` rather than
taken from `FMC-style/BothTransparent.png`, whose Clear bottle carries the same
olive cast rejected for the Clear slides. Compositing also gives 799x874
against that file's 548x564.

`b2` is the one slide with authored copy: `whatToExpectV2.ts` has no `"03"`
block, so its milestones do not exist in the repo. It is structured around the
two-shot day (morning / afternoon / week 1 / week 2+) rather than an onset
timeline, which is Both's actual proposition.

`b0` / `b0q` inherit a fault: `BothStartPackClean` shows only Flow-labelled
bottles. A Both pack should show a Flow/Clear mix.

## The running photograph on `shared-tested`

The testing slide runs over a black-and-white running photograph, on the logic
that Informed Sport is an athlete certification. **Its source is only
399x501**, so at the current panel width it is upscaled roughly 3.9x. It holds
together because the dark treatment hides the softness, but it is the one
asset in the set running below its source resolution and a high-resolution
replacement is the single best thing to swap in.

## Alternatives kept but not chosen

`previews/p4a-ingredients-wheel.html` (a 15-spoke ring) and
`previews/p4b-ingredients-split.html` (AM/PM columns) were both built for
Both's ingredient slide. The two-row layout in `slides/b3.html` won because it
shows the bottles at real size *and* labels every ingredient with its
mechanism. Render the alternatives by hand, not via `render.sh`, so they do
not land in `public/`.
