## 2. CUSTOMER JOURNEY & CRO

### Site Routes / Funnel

|-------|---------|
| `/` | Homepage — hero, athlete carousel, product grid, testimonials, why CONKA, FAQ |
| `/quiz` | 10-question product recommendation quiz |
| `/quiz/results` | Recommended protocol with scores, tier selector, add-to-cart |
| `/conka-flow` | Flow product detail page |
| `/conka-clarity` | Clarity product detail page |
| `/protocol/[id]` | Protocol detail pages (1-4) |
| `/shop` | All formulas showcase |
| `/professionals` | B2B professional portal |
| `/app` | Mobile app landing page with download links |
| `/science` | Science & research page |
| `/our-story` | Founder story |

| `/ingredients` | Ingredient detail page |
| `/case-studies` | Athlete case studies |
| `/win` | Contest/giveaway email capture |
| `/account` | Customer account portal |
| `/account/subscriptions` | Subscription management |

### Primary Conversion Path (Quiz-Driven)

1. Homepage → "Take the Quiz" CTA
2. `/quiz` → 10 questions with progress bar
3. Submit → Loading animation
4. `/quiz/results` → Recommended protocol + all scores
5. Select tier (Starter/Pro/Max) + purchase type toggle (subscription saves 20%)
6. "Add to Cart" → Cart drawer opens
7. "Checkout" → Shopify-hosted checkout

### Secondary Conversion Path (Direct Product)

1. Homepage scroll → Product Grid or nav link
2. Product page → Pack size + purchase type selector
3. "Add to Cart" (from hero or sticky footer)
4. Cart drawer → Checkout

### Quiz Flow Details

**10 Questions:**
1. "Do you experience brain fog throughout the day?"
2. "Do you have a mid-afternoon energy crash?"
3. "Do you have difficulties falling asleep at night?"
4. "How many times per week do you train intensely?"
5. "What best describes your primary athletic focus?"
6. "Do you regularly experience head impacts or collisions?"
7. "How would you rate your memory?"
8. "Are you currently taking any cognitive or wellness supplements?"
9. "How cognitively demanding is your typical day?"
10. "What's your #1 goal with CONKA?"

Each answer scores 0-3 points toward each of the 4 protocols. Results show percentage match and recommended protocol.

### Email Capture Mechanics

1. **Win/Giveaway Page** (`/win`) — Contest email capture, stores in Convex, subscribes to Klaviyo list `WBbMia`
2. **Cognitive Test Email Gate** — Email required before starting cognitive test, consent checkbox: "I agree to receive my cognitive test results via email"
3. **Barrys Partnership Form** — Contest-based email capture with discount CTA
4. **Footer Newsletter** — "Never miss out—sign up for newsletters from CONKA. Tips, research and offers. No spam."

### Social Proof Elements

- **Athlete Credibility Carousel** — Auto-scrolling strip of athlete testimonials
- **Testimonials Section** — Auto-scrolling cards, product-specific filtering (Flow, Clarity, Protocol)
- **Trust/Assurance Banner:**

### Sticky Purchase Footer

- Always-visible CTA when scrolling product/protocol pages
- Pack size + tier selectors
- Subscription vs one-time toggle

### Discount & Promotional Offers

- **Subscription discount:** Automatic 20% off vs one-time (displayed as "SAVE 20%" green badge)
- **RETENTION15:** 15% off next 3 deliveries — triggered during cancellation flow for "too expensive" reason
- **Banner system:** `BannerDesktop` / `BannerMobile` components support promo code copy-to-clipboard, marquee layout, urgent highlighting

### A/B Tests

- **No explicit A/B test infrastructure found.** However, the codebase supports variant props on Hero ("default"/"dark"), product grid layouts (mobile/tablet/desktop), and analytics session tracking that could support experimentation.

### Exit Intent

- **No explicit exit-intent popup.** Retention is handled by sticky purchase footer (always visible), cancellation modals with winback offers, and "Retake Quiz" re-engagement loop.

### Mobile vs Desktop

- Breakpoints: Mobile <768px, Tablet 768-1024px, Desktop ≥1024px

### Shopify Configuration

- **Public Access Token:** `99b077c7dac39ab9dc5f64b4dcc88502`
- **Customer Account Client ID:** `2ffc8429-5053-42ff-94ed-e5d2e3b36f76`
- **Shop ID:** `69347049757`

### Checkout

- **No custom checkout** — entirely Shopify-hosted via `cart.checkoutUrl`
- Payment, shipping, tax all managed by Shopify
- Discount codes entered at Shopify checkout (native functionality)
- No intermediate payment processing

### Cart Behavior

- **Persistence:** Cart ID in `localStorage` as `shopify_cart_id`; cart data lives in Shopify
- **Cart API:** `POST /api/cart` with actions: `create`, `add`, `update`, `updateMultiple`, `remove`
- **Checkout redirect:** `cart.checkoutUrl` from Shopify Cart API
- **Post-checkout:** `clearCart()` removes localStorage reference only

**Cart Line Item Attributes (LTV Tagging):**
- `source`: "quiz" | "product_page" | "protocol_page" | "product_grid" | "professional_portal" | "direct"
- `plan_frequency`: "weekly" | "biweekly" | "monthly" (for subscriptions)

**B2B Tier Normalization:**
- Automatic tier recalculation after every cart mutation
- Tier bands: Starter 1-10 boxes | Squad 11-25 boxes | Elite 26+ boxes
- Ultimate Protocol = 2 boxes per unit for tier calculation
- All items in cart normalized to same tier (separate B2B variant IDs per tier)
- VAT message for B2B: "Prices include VAT at 20%. Please email sales@conka.io for an invoice after purchase."

**Subscription Retry Logic:** If variant doesn't support selling plan, automatically retries as one-time purchase.

### Discount Code Logic

- **No custom discount code application for one-time purchases** — handled natively by Shopify at checkout
- **Subscription discounts** applied via Loop API: `POST /subscription/{loopId}/discount` with `{ code: 'CODE' }`
- **Retention discount** (RETENTION15): Applied from CancellationModal during churn prevention

### Order Fulfillment

- Orders fetched via Shopify Customer Account API for display in `/account`
- No custom fulfillment logic in codebase
- Loop manages recurring subscription order creation automatically

### Shopify Apps/Plugins

- **Loop Subscriptions** — All subscription management (billing, pausing, cancellation, plan changes)
- No other Shopify apps detected in codebase

---

## 4. SUBSCRIPTION & RETENTION

### Platform: Loop Subscriptions

- **API Version:** `2023-10`
- **Base URL:** `https://api.loopsubscriptions.com/admin/2023-10`
- **Auth:** `X-Loop-Token` header

### Subscription Plans

| Plan | Interval | Selling Plan ID | Selling Plan Group ID |
|------|----------|----------------|----------------------|
| Starter | Weekly | 711429882230 | 98722480502 |
| Pro | Bi-weekly | 711429947766 | 98722546038 |
| Max | Monthly | 711429980534 | 98722578806 |

### Subscription Statuses

`active` → `paused` → `active` (auto-resume)
`active` → `cancelled` → `active` (manual reactivation)
`active` → `expired`

### Cancellation Flow (3-Step Modal)

**Step 1 — Reason Selection:**
1. Too expensive
2. Not seeing results
3. Deliveries too frequent
4. Deliveries too infrequent
5. Switching to a different product
6. No longer needed
7. Other reason

**Step 2 — Retention Offer (reason-dependent):**

| Reason | Offer | Action |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Too expensive | "How about 15% off? We'd love you to stay. 15% off your next 3 deliveries — no strings attached." | Apply `RETENTION15` discount code |
| Not seeing results | "Take a break instead?" | Open pause modal |
| No longer needed | "Pause for a while instead?" | Open pause modal |
| Too frequent | "Adjust your delivery schedule?" | Open edit modal |
| Too infrequent | "Get deliveries more often?" | Open edit modal |
| Switching product / Other | No offer | Proceed to confirmation |

**Step 3 — Final Confirmation:** Cancellation processed with reason, Loop sends email notification.

### Churn Reduction Mechanics

1. **Pause instead of cancel** — 1-3 billing cycles, auto-resumes after duration
2. **RETENTION15 discount** — 15% off next 3 deliveries, one use per customer
3. **Flexible plan/frequency changes** — Switch tiers, protocols, or intervals
4. **Reactivation** — Cancelled subscriptions can be restored anytime from account page
5. **Skip next order** — Skip without cancelling
6. **Reschedule delivery** — Move next delivery date (min 3 days, max 1 cycle)
7. **Place order now** — Trigger immediate delivery, shifts schedule forward

### Customer Portal Features

| Action | Implementation |
|--------|---------------|
| View subscriptions | Hybrid: Shopify contract IDs + Loop details |
| Pause | 1-3 billing cycles with estimated resume date |
| Resume | Resume on scheduled date or resume immediately |
