## Copy Guidelines

### When Writing Copy, Always:

1. **Use PMID links** when citing clinical studies
2. **Match statistics exactly** to SOURCES.md values
3. **Include study context** (participants, duration) when space allows
4. **Attribute to ingredients** not to "CONKA" directly (regulatory compliance)

### Approved Phrasing:

✅ "Ashwagandha has been shown to reduce cortisol by 28% in clinical studies"
✅ "Curcumin improved memory by 63% in an 18-month UCLA trial"
✅ "Our athletes have seen up to 36% improvement in cognitive testing"

### Avoid:

❌ "CONKA reduces stress by 56%" (implies drug claim)
❌ "Clinically proven to..." (regulatory red flag)
❌ "250+ clinical studies" (unverified number)
