            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
              applications include a Do-Not-Track (&apos;DNT&apos;) feature or
              setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to
              have data about your online browsing activities monitored and
              collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for
              recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As
              such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any
              other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to
              be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted
              that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
              practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-6">
              California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web
              browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or
              legal standard for recognising or honouring DNT signals, we do not
              respond to them at this time.
