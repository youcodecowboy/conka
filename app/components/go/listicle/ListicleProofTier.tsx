/* ============================================================================
 * Listicle proof, split across the page
 *
 * The post-reasons proof is no longer one stacked block. It is distributed so
 * the tail escalates instead of repeating:
 *
 *   ListicleLogoBand  -> institutional trust, directly UNDER THE HERO
 *                        (partner logos + optional press/journal logos).
 *                        Moved up from above the buy box in SCRUM-1321:
 *                        only 8-17% of visitors ever reach the buy box, so
 *                        down there the proof wall was invisible to most.
 *   ListicleProofTier -> AFTER the buy box, running into the FAQ:
 *                        one named human (feature), then the UGC band last so
 *                        it sits directly before the FAQ.
 *
 * Written customer reviews are intentionally not here: the mid-reasons review
 * strip already carries them, and the UGC band does the social-proof work.
 *
 * Content-only: no <section>, no max-width, no horizontal padding at root. The
 * renderers own the section wrapper and background. See SCRUM-1176.
