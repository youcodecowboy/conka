/**
 * Section attribution for the /go listicles.
 *
 * Answers two questions per page: which sections people actually reach, and
 * which sections produce CTA clicks. The first is the denominator for the
 * second, so both are needed to tell a weak section from a rarely-reached one.
 *
 * Both templates wrap their body in <SectionImpressions slug>, then mark each
 * block with <TrackedSection section>. One IntersectionObserver serves the
 * whole page: TrackedSection registers its element with the provider rather
 * than creating an observer of its own. The slug lives only on the provider,
 * so no call site can tag an event with the wrong page.
 *
 * The observer itself lives in app/components/analytics/sectionImpressions.tsx,
 * shared with the PDPs (SCRUM-1260). This file keeps the listicle's slug and
 * its three event senders, so the emitted stream is unchanged.
 *
 * Event shapes and the two-property budget: see app/lib/analytics.ts.
