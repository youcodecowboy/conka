 * ProductHeroV3, the two-column PDP hero (Flow, Clear, Both).

 * A large sticky asset on the LEFT; the RIGHT column holds the buy decision:
 * rating, name, badges, buy box, the product lede, then the four disclosure
 * rows (ingredients, who it is for, taste, how to take).
 *
 * The hero stops at the buy decision (SCRUM-1262). It used to carry a
 * written-out ingredient list under the gallery and the outcome accordions
 * under the buy box, which together meant desktop argued ingredients three
 * times once the body grid existed. Both are gone; the buy panel's pill opens
 * the full list, and the grid is the ingredient surface.
 *
 * Desktop only; mobile uses ProductHeroMobileV3, which now mirrors it.
 * ProductHeroV2 (3-column) is retained as the fallback but no longer routed to.
