/**
 * GiftValueStack — the starter-pack gift grid (SCRUM-1283).
 *
 * Struck RRP per tile, the IM8 / Graymatter pattern, rather than an unpriced
 * tick list. Every figure is display-only and pre-add: the cart and checkout
 * still price from Shopify alone (CART_PRICING_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md).
 *
 * Content only, and deliberately without its own box. It renders inside the
 * SubscriptionSummary card so the panel carries one bordered block rather than
 * two stacked ones, which doubled the panel height on mobile. The caller owns
 * the divider above it.
 *
 * Two columns at 390px, four from `sm:` up. Four across on a phone leaves about
 * 78px per tile, too tight for the struck price to stay legible, and the price
 * is the point of this pattern.
 *
 * Thumbnails are a fixed 80px rather than filling the cell. Full-bleed squares
 * rendered at roughly 270px each and cost about 800px of panel for four tiles,
 * which buried the CTA on mobile.
 *
 * The tiles and their total come from `getCadenceGiftSummary` in cadenceData
 * rather than being summed here, because the hero's offer badge shows the same
 * figures (SCRUM-1334) and the two must not be able to drift.
