//   one-time prices for now; the itemised split returns when SCRUM-1286

// - The reference unit is the MONTHLY-SIZE ONE-TIME ORDER, all-in (product +
//   per-order postage). Anchors scale linearly from it: a quarterly offering
//   anchors to three such orders, each paying its own postage. This makes the
//   discount ladder ascend with quantity and commitment (the Magic Mind
//   pattern, decided by Rudh 28 Aug 2026): larger pack, bigger badge. The

//   three times), so it carries its own badge and is never an anchor.

//   the £89.99 Both box (PROVISIONAL, 2026-08-28: adjustable data, see the
//   ops doc's decision note).
