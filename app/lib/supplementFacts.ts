/**
 * Canonical per-product supplement-facts records.
 *
 * Source of truth: docs/product/FORMULATION_SPEC.md (2026-04-13).
 * Purpose: factual disclosure panel rendered in `IngredientsPanel` on the
 * landing page. Separate from `ingredientsData.ts` (research-dose storytelling)
 * and `formulaContent.ts` (legacy percentages — pending sync).
 *
 * Competitive IP protection: per-ingredient mg amounts are deliberately NOT
 * shipped to the client. Ingredient ORDER is preserved — standard supplement-
 * facts convention lists ingredients in descending order of concentration, so
 * relative quantity is still communicated without exposing the formula.
 * Only Vitamin C and Vitamin B12 carry %NRV values (needed to substantiate
 * the authorised EFSA claims).
 *
 * Claims compliance:
 * - Only Vitamin C and Vitamin B12 carry authorised EFSA claims.
 * - Functional-group copy uses observational phrasing.
 * - Anchor `††` on EFSA-backed nutrient references.
 * See docs/development/LANDING_PAGE_CLAIMS_LOG.md.
