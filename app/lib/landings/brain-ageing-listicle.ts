 * Restructured 2026-07-23 (conversion pass) into a true numbered "X reasons"
 * listicle: a counted hero and 7 tight reasons, one idea each, statement
 * headlines, pain-first openings. The men/women segmentToggle is kept as one
 * reason (men's body trimmed); the verbose mechanism detail and search-question
 * framing move to the parallel /blog work (SCRUM-1175). One stats band and one
 * review strip sit between reasons so the page reads as a scannable list.
 * Template stays "im8". Claims pass is owned by the user.
 *
 * Slug is brain-ageing-listicle to avoid colliding with the brain-age QUIZ
 * page (/go/brain-age, SCRUM-1084).
