 * Persona listicle: ADHD.
 *
 * Restructured 2026-07-23 (conversion pass, SCRUM-listicle-rework) into a true
 * numbered "X reasons" listicle: a counted hero and 7 tight numbered reasons,
 * one idea each. The interactive symptom explainer is slimmed to 4 core
 * symptoms as reason 1; the full 10-symptom breakdown, the per-ingredient
 * mechanisms and the citations move to the parallel /blog post (SCRUM-1175).
 * Only one stats band and one review strip sit between reasons so the page
 * reads as a scannable list. Template stays "im8" (the only one that renders
 * the symptom explainer + data-viz assets). Claims pass is owned by the user.
 *
 * TODO(FAQ): Humphrey's bespoke ADHD FAQ copy was not delivered (ran out of
 * credits). Until it lands, the persona reuses existing canonical faqIds.
