/**
 * Persona listicle: productivity / "smart people".
 *
 * Restructured 2026-07-23 (conversion pass) into a true numbered "X reasons"
 * listicle: a counted hero and 7 tight reasons, one idea each, statement
 * headlines, pain-first openings. The verbose mechanism detail and the
 * search-question framing move to the parallel /blog work (SCRUM-1175). One
 * stats band and one review strip sit between reasons so the page reads as a
 * scannable list. Template stays "im8". Claims pass is owned by the user.
 *
 * Repositioned 2026-07-27 (SCRUM-1187) to a founder-led "high performers"
 * have-it-all angle to message-match the founder-driven ads and fix the weak
 * first fold. Hero carries the founder proof (TwoFounders photo + Harry/Humphrey
 * juggler origin); reasons re-themed off generic caffeine fights to: 1 performance-
 * without-burnout, 2 socialise-keep-tomorrow, 3 founder cheat-code, 4 have-it-all,
 * 5 sharp-all-day, 6 app-proof, 7 guarantee. Diagnosis + rationale:
 * docs/analytics/LISTICLE_PERFORMANCE.md. Shane's exec quote sits on
 * reason 1 as a quote tile; Nimisha's quote is still deferred.
