 * ASSET RECOMMENDATIONS (per stage, optional):
 * - Flow: (1) Person taking shot / morning ritual. (2) Calm workspace or morning routine.
 *   (3) Focused work or exercise. (4) Balanced lifestyle / wind-down. (5) Long-term habit / bottle in routine.
 * - Clear: (1) Desk / screen work, clear head. (2) Supplement + water. (3) Deep work / clarity moment.
 *   (4) Sustained focus / week view. (5) Wellness routine.
 * Style: Real lifestyle or product-in-use; avoid stock clichés. Optional: subtle abstract (e.g. neurons, antioxidants)
