# Page Rules

## Section structure
- Use `brand-section` + `brand-bg-{white|tint|black}` classes from `app/brand-base.css` (the single stylesheet). Track: `brand-track`.
  - **Exception: full-bleed split bands** (DESIGN_SYSTEM.md §8.5). A band whose image must reach the viewport edge gets a bare `<section>` carrying only the background and `aria-label`, and the component owns the split. Live on `/our-story`. Every other section on such a page stays tracked as normal.
- Alternate section backgrounds to create visual rhythm.
- Each section gets `aria-label` for accessibility.

## SEO (mandatory, not optional)
- Export `metadata` or `generateMetadata` with: title (with " | CONKA"), description (<160 chars), OpenGraph (title, description, image).
- Single H1 per page. Logical heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3, no skips).
- All images have meaningful alt text (not "image" or "photo").
- Product pages include JSON-LD structured data.
- Canonical URL if risk of duplicate content.

## Mobile-first composition
- 74% of traffic is mobile. Review the page at 390px width before desktop.
- Hero content and primary CTA must be visible without scrolling on mobile.
- Use `loading.tsx` for Suspense boundaries on data-fetching pages.

## Premium quality check
- No section should feel flat. Use layered surfaces, background variation, visual depth.
- Each section should have distinct visual identity while feeling connected to the whole.
- Apply the "quickly consumable" test: can someone understand each section in <3 seconds on mobile?
