# Component Rules

## Design system compliance
- Use design tokens from `app/brand-base.css` — never hard-code colours, spacing, radii, or font sizes.
- Radius depends on the surface's design language (DESIGN_SYSTEM.md §8.5). Simple DTC surfaces (cart, home, PDPs, landing/build-your-order) use Tailwind utilities: `rounded-md` cards/containers/controls, `rounded-lg` standalone tiles, `rounded-full` pills/buttons. Clinical + App-Dark surfaces use the `--brand-radius-*` tokens, which `.brand-clinical` forces to `0px`.
- Components return content only — no `<section>`, no `max-w-*`, no `px-*` at root. Pages own section wrappers.
  - **One sanctioned exception: the full-bleed split band** (DESIGN_SYSTEM.md §8.5). When an image must reach the viewport edge and run the full height of its band, the page gives a bare `<section>` with only a background and `aria-label`, and the component owns the split. The copy side pads its outer edge with `--brand-track-inset` so text still aligns with tracked sections. Live on `/our-story`. Do not reach for it unless the image genuinely has to touch the viewport edge.
- Components do not set their own background. Exception: cards/surfaces that differ from section bg must set their own text colour explicitly.

## Mobile-first enforcement
- Write base Tailwind classes for mobile (390px). Add complexity at `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:` breakpoints.
- If layout differs significantly between mobile and desktop, split into separate Mobile/Desktop files with `useIsMobile()` hook (breakpoint: lg/1024px).
- Every interactive element must have a minimum 44x44px tap target.

## Quickly consumable
- One idea per visual group. If a section requires connecting information across scroll positions, simplify.
- Prefer: stats, badges, icons, short headlines. Use prose only for supporting detail.
- Progressive disclosure: show the headline, let the user expand for depth.
